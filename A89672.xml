            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THat indifferent good Reception which my Bookſeller informs me, that the former Part of this Conference has met withal in the World, has made me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to venture abroad a ſecond. It is my hearty Prayer to God, that theſe mean Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours may contribute to the abating that reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infidelity which has poiſoned ſuch a number of the Gentry, and others of this Nation; or at leaſt may ſtir up ſome abler Pen, to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with it this way: For after all the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I have heard made to me about my free way of arguing the Theiſtical Arguments in Dialogue, I think it is more like to do good among the Infidels, than a Methodical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ranged into Chapter and Section; for thoſe that are tainted with theſe Opinions are generally a ſort of faſtidious Students, who though they talk much, read but very little, and every thing which is deſigned for their uſe muſt be attempered to their Palats, to make it go down with them. Now the Dialogical way of all others is moſt apt to excite Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by conſtantly ſpringing up new Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſet a continual edge upon the Mind, and make it eager to ſee them removed; ſo that the Author of a Dialogue has this advan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tage above others, that he carries the Read<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

are generally loſt, or at leaſt often grow lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid in a continued Diſcourſe of any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able length. I have not indeed brought in ſuch frequent Interlocutions as are requiſite for a juſt Dialogue, like thoſe of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Lucian:</hi> For that would have taken up a great deal more Paper to little purpoſe, only to pleaſe a few curious Criticks; and at laſt the Argument would be but the more obſcured by it. And on the other ſide I have avoided the dry me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Scholaſtick Ob. and Sol. where the Objection is propoſed without any manner of Life, only in order to be refuted; which can never be pleaſant to the Reader, who at firſt ſight ſees that the Author ſets this up only as a Man of Straw, which whan he fights with it he ſhall be ſure to get the better of. I have therefore made uſe of the middle way, in clothing the Objections in ſuch a dreſs, as two Men that had a mind to convince one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can be ſuppoſed to uſe. And this is the Pattern which the beſt of Writers, <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his Philoſophical Tracts has ſet; whoſe very faults I ſhould never be aſhamed to imitate.</p>
            <p>As to thoſe Tragical Exclamations which ſome honeſt People have made concerning my urging the Infidels Arguments with that little Wit and Briskneſs, with which they are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly talked in; and putting ſome Expreſſions in my Deiſts Mouth which reflect upon Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: I cannot, upon the moſt ſerious Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, approve their Zeal. For when I was to write a Dialogue upon this Subject, I muſt make the <hi>Theiſt</hi> ſay ſomething or other; and I think I ſhould but little have obſerved
<pb facs="tcp:172675:5"/>
the Rules of Decency, to have made the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del talk in the Language of a Grave Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue. For, I am ſure, if I had done ſo, I had made more People laugh at me, than now I have made angry. Beſides, I have the whole World before me for Precedents in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thoſe Atheiſtical <hi>Proſopopoea's</hi> which are are brought in by <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> are urged with a peculiar Poignancy of Wit, which the Atheiſts of all Times have endeavoured to excel in. And <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Natura Deorum,</hi> frames the Arguments of <hi>Velleius</hi> the <hi>Epicurean,</hi> with a great deal more Wit and Smartneſs, than thoſe of <hi>Cotta</hi> the Academick, or <hi>Balbus</hi> the Stoick. And in the ſame ſtrain all along in <hi>Minutius Foelix, Cecilius</hi> expoſes the Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion. And ſo the Arguments of <hi>Trypho</hi> the Jew, recorded in <hi>Juſtin Martyr;</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Celſus</hi> in <hi>Origen,</hi> and of <hi>Julian</hi> in St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> are more Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Reflexions and Inſinuations againſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, than any that are found in this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. If any ſhall ſay that I help vitious Men to Arguments againſt Religion: I anſwer, that theſe Arguments are common enough to be found elſewhere; and thoſe whoſe Minds are byaſſed this way, know well enough where to look for them in thoſe wicked Books, where they may find all the Poiſon without the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote.</p>
            <p>As to thoſe Schemes of the Creation and the Deluge I have made in this and the former Part, I muſt tell the Reader again, that I deſign them only as poſſible Theories; which I do not lay down as if they were exactly true, but that
<pb facs="tcp:172675:6"/>
they might be ſo; which is all I am concerned to prove againſt the Infidels who deny the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of theſe Mighty Revolutions. And thoſe People that pretend to be angry at any Philoſophical Explication of the Creation and the Deluge in this way, may as well be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with <hi>Butio</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> for proving the Poſſibility of the Reception of the Animals in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, and with the generality of the Commentators upon the Bible, who do upon occaſions ſhew the Poſſibility of thoſe many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Relations which are found there.</p>
            <p>If this Part finds as kind uſage abroad among thoſe Judgments I moſt value, as the former did; or if I can learn it does any good among thoſe I deſign'd it for, I will publiſh the Third and laſt Part: or otherwiſe I have done with the Subject, and

The Room it ſelf was adorned with all the beautiful Paint and Figures

which a skilful hand could add, and the Books were Methodically ranged into various Claſſes, under the Images of Ancient Philoſophers and Poets, and ſome other celebrated Modern Writers. Nor was there wanting any Greek Philoſophical, or Philological Writer down from <hi>Homer</hi> to <hi>Pletho;</hi> and all the Latin Claſſicks ſtood in the exacteſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the moſt curious binding; and what yet commended them moſt, they were chiefly of the charming Editions of <hi>Aldus,</hi> the <hi>Stephani,</hi> and <hi>Vaſcoſanus.</hi> Here were all the Learned <hi>Adverſaria,</hi> Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the famous Philologers of this, and the laſt Age, <hi>Trapezuntius, Valla, Volateranus,</hi> the <hi>Scaligers</hi> and <hi>Caſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons;</hi> here was a Collection of every thing curious in the Philoſophy of the Moderns up to <hi>Petrach</hi> and <hi>Mirandula;</hi> all the Wits of our own and the Neighbouring Nations, every thing uſeful and delicate in the Methematicks and Poetry, moſt ſingular ſets of the Modern Hiſtory, Maps and Travels; in ſhort a well choſe Collection of the moſt refined and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Authors, which may tend to render the ſtudy of a Gentleman agreeable and to highten his Genius. <hi>Philologus</hi> drawing a Chair for him to ſit down, according to his wonted pleaſantneſs, tells <hi>Credentius</hi> he

Adding with all, that the Entertainment too of that nature would be very mean, and be no tolerable recompence for that inſtructive Diſcourſe he was pleaſed to afford him the other day, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted had made him ever ſince both wiſer and better.</p>

I muſt demand an account why ſimple Natural Religion ſhould not perform as acceptable a ſervice to God Almighty, as when 'tis cumbered with Jewiſh and Chriſtian Rites; why God ſhould not as well be pleaſed with a Mans doing his duty himſelf as for the ſake of a Mediator; and to what purpoſe a Man muſt be forc'd to believe the Inſpiration of a few Books wrote I know not when, and by I know not whom; and which for the moſt part tell us no more but what Natural Religion told us before.

               <p>I proteſt the cunning Blades had a brave time of it when they could fill their Bellies at the peoples charge, who thought themſelves well paid to look on and ſee them feed. But in the mean time the poor folk were miſerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool'd, when they were made to believe, that they rendered the Deity more their Friend or themſelves the better Men by ſtuffing the Prieſts Guts. For what ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Fat Bullock to God-Almighty? but the roguiſh Prieſts knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough what uſe to make of it, when it ſerved them thus to gormandize upon. And truly their Brethren of the holy Tribe have kept up the ſame Craft and Legerdemain ever ſince. It is but the ſame Juggle of the deſigning Prieſthood that upholds all the ſuperſtitions in the World; that maintains both the Pagods of <hi>India,</hi> the Moſques of <hi>Turky,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides ſo confortable a maintenance for all the ſanctified Gentlemen here in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> The plain dictates of nature are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:172675:13"/>
a thouſand times a better Rule of Life than the fooliſh rites preſcribed by theſe ſuperſtitious Coxcombs; that rook the people of their money by telling them ſtrange Tales and exhibiting odd Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies for them to gape at. What cann't a Man Live and Die as becomes a good Man without Sacrifices and <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> and Sacraments and Abſolution?

For my part I grudge thoſe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies every morſel of Bread they eat; and think that Cheats and Pick-Pockets ought to be maintain'd at the charge of the Nation as well as they. It vexes me to think that the generality of people ſhould be ſuch Cullies to part ſo eaſily with ſo conſiderable a part of their Eſtates to pay their Prieſts for Hypocriſy and Lyes; and at the ſame time to adore their Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for their Piety and Good ſervice. For my part, they ſhall get as little of my money as ever they can; and I generally tell them their own when ever I meet them. I know two or three of our Neighbours that tamely deliver up their Noſe to their Prieſts Fingers, and truly you, <hi>Credentius,</hi> ſuffer them to buzze about you like ſo many Flies, but

you have ſenſe enough to diſcover the Foxes Ears through the Sheeps Livery; it is only your good nature that hinders you from doing any thing unkind to any one; but for my part, I make the Sparks know their Diſtance, I give them no quarter when ever they fall in my way; and that makes them as much ſcar'd at my Company as the common People are at their Tales.</p>

                  <p>I perceive, <hi>Philologus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of vilifying the Clergy.</note> you have a little tranſported your ſelf by your own Talk, and have loſt your Argument to railly upon the Clergy. But I muſt needs tell you, that this cuſtom you have got of expoſing the Profeſſion and Perſons of the Clergy is one of the worſt qualities I diſcern in <hi>Philologus,</hi> and is a great blemiſh to thoſe other Gentleman-like accompliſhments which adorn his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. I ſhall ſpeak to that ſimplicity you would have in Religion, by and by; but in the mean time, I muſt beg leave to ſpeak a word or two upon this irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ill-bred Cuſtom of abuſing Clergy-men, which has ſo much obtained among the Gentlemen of this Age. Now this piece of ill-breeding was not of our own Growth here in <hi>England,</hi> it was brought, like the reſt of our Follies, from <hi>France.</hi> Our travelling Gentry, who had ſpent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:172675:14"/>
their time to no purpoſe beyond Sea, thought they muſt bring home ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remarkable, and it was generally that little banter and drollery with which the French Gentlemen uſed to make ſport with their ignorant Friars and Curees. All the improvement it gained in our Nation was more Malice and more Dullneſs; for we Engliſh are generally a grave ſober Nation, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing looks ſo awkwar'd in us, and is ſuch a force upon our tempers, as Drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery; ſo that when once we go to imitate Fools we generally are ſuch. And indeed we have imitated the French in this but miſerable ſillily; for I think there is no compariſon of our Clergy and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of their Friars who are commonly very ignorant and ſilly, and often-times not only lewd themſelves but Panders to other Mens Debauchery. But gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally our Clergy live lives of Vertue and ſtrict Piety, at leaſt few of them are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly vitious; their Education is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſuch as gives them Learning, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual at leaſt to the Neighbouring Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen; and conſidering the remiſs Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Gentry under the late Reigns, for the moſt part ſuperiour. There is nothing vile and contemptible in their Profeſſion, as there is in ſome
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:172675:14"/>
which tend to vanity or debauchery, or which do denote ſome vile ſervitude and drudgery; but their calling is high and noble, the ſubject of it God, and the moſt ſublime and divine Truths; and the end which they drive at, is to make Men good and peaceable. Now there is nothing in all this that ſhould render this order of Men the ſubject of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Drollery; and Men might, if they pleaſe, with as much advantage, make ſport with Phyſicians and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, as they do with Divines. Give me leave to ſay, it is an unmerciful piece of Barbarity to fall foul upon innocent Men, to abuſe their Perſons and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when there is no manner of provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given them for it; nay, it is moſt piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cowardice to give ſuch uſage only to thoſe who they know, by the Character of their Profeſſion, muſt not revenge it, which they dare not offer to thoſe whom they ſuſpect may. If ſuch a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Goſpel, he offers one of the greateſt injuries to Religion, by expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Miniſters of it, and leſſening their credit, whereby they are leſs able to reform the lives of wicked Men; and doth withal fooliſhly give the lye to his Faith, by ridiculing and affronting the Officers of that holy Inſtitution, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:172675:15"/>
by his Baptiſm and Communion he has declared the greateſt Veneration for. And truly a Man may as well pretend to bear a great reſpect to the Government, when he is always expoſing and traducing the King and his ſubordinate Magiſtrates, as to pretend an eſteem to Chriſtianity, and to be always railing at its Miniſters. This is a practice ſo ſhameful among Chriſtians, that would render them an opprobry to Infidels, in ſeeing them ſo diſgracing the Diſpenſers of thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Myſteries they hope to be ſaved by. Nay to ſpeak more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, neither will the known faults of ſome, or many Clergy-men, excuſe this Cuſtom; becauſe though ſome are faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there are others who conſcientiouſly perform their duty in all reſpects; and therefore to involve all under the ſame imputation is ſhameful Injuſtice. But beſides, the faults of a Clergy-man are of ſo tender a nature, and are of ſo nigh a concern to Chriſtianity, that for the credit of Religion all good Men will be very cautious of divulging them; and therefore where-ever we find Men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to pick up and relate ſtories of this nature, 'tis a certain ſign they are no Friends to the eſtabliſhed Religion, and is uſually a ſign that they are no good
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:172675:15"/>
likers of the common Chriſtianity. And truly, <hi>Philologus,</hi> I muſt own that the Gentlemen of your Sentiments have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken very proper methods by vilifying the Clergy to propagate your Opinions, for this one reaſon, becauſe it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be obſerved, that the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Atheiſts and Deiſts, in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is made up of ſuch, as have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before they declared for Infidelity, been the greateſt Railers againſt their Parſons. I will not determine whether this comes to paſs by the Judgment of God, or the natural tendency of the thing; but this is certain, as far as my obſervation can reach, that the chiefeſt of the Body of theſe Infidels is made out of the Antimonarchical and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Party of the late Reigns, and the Jacobites in this; Men that are grown ſowr'd and peeviſh at the miſcarriage of their deſign, and exaſperated againſt the Clergy for their oppoſition to their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices; and ſo have reſolved at laſt to be revenged upon Religion in ſpight to its Miniſters. But I'll warrant you by that ſmile, <hi>Philologus,</hi> you imagine that the compliance of the Clergy with the laſt Reigns, and at laſt with the preſent Government, is the true reaſon of the growth of Infidelity now. I ſhall leave
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:172675:16"/>
the Gentlemen of that Order to juſtify their own actions, who know their own Conſcience beſt. But thus much I will ſay, that if the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> had not complied with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, we had had, by this time, ſuch a medly and confuſion in Religion, as would have made a great many Men have nauſeated all. For nothing can be ſo great a cauſe of Infidelity as the unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted licenſe of Fanatical Zeal and Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm; and for one Atheiſt or Deiſt we have now we ſhould have had twenty then. And it may be we had been in as bad a condition if the Clergy had not vigorouſly oppoſed the Rebellious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practices of thoſe dangerous Phanaticks, and their Abettors, who were going to overthrow a Lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and an Orthodox Church. So that I am ſo far from condemning the Practice of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in theſe laſt Reigns, that I highly approve it, both as being very uniform, and of a piece with its ſelf, and very conſonant to Reaſon and Law. For by the ſame reaſon they comply with this Government which is eſtabliſhed by Law; they refuſed to comply with the Illegal demands of King <hi>James,</hi> who was acting againſt Law, and to their utmoſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:172675:16"/>
oppoſed the unlawful Seditions, and at laſt Rebellion of Factious People, who were for advancing the Title of a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Heir, who had no pretence to the Crown by any Law in the World, in oppoſition to two Succeſſive Princes, who had undoubted Right to, and were in actual poſſeſſion of it; and to the injury of all the lawful branches of it. So much I have thought fit to ſay concerning the Abuſes which are frequently given to Clergy-men, by Men that have not caſt off all regard to Chriſtianity, but are willing to lay hold on any pretence to fall foul upon them, and to wreek their Spleen. But further, as to Gentlemen of your perſwaſion, who look upon our Religion to be a Fable, and think you can have no tie upon you from that; yet methinks Civility and common Juſtice, which you pretend to be the greateſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for, ſhould reſtrain you from abuſing any one, eſpecially thoſe who are uſed to beſpeak you with all civility and reſpect. And as for their Dues which you make a ſport in defrauding them of, you know, by Law, they have as good a Title to them as you have to your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; and your Copy-holders might, with the ſame Juſtice, detain your Quit-Rents, as you do their Tithes. And if
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:172675:17"/>
Religion be only a Politick Contrivance of State, if the Law think fit to direct it ſo, the Clergy by inſtructing Men to be Virtuous and Religious, and by that means keeping Men peaceable at home, have as good a Plea for the Tenth of our Eſtates, as the Souldiers have now for the Fifth, for fighting againſt our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad.</p>
                  <p>I beg your Pardon for this long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion from our main deſign, which yet your diſcourſe led me to. And now I ſhall ſpeak to the Argument of your Poetical Friend; which one would think ſhould be irrefragable, conſidering it is ſo often repeated by your Gentlemen with ſuch Grace and Emphaſis.</p>
                  <q>The Prieſts eat Roaſt meat, and the People ſtar'd.</q>

                     <note place="margin">The People partook of the ancient Sacrifices.</note>But had not the People their ſhare of Roaſt meat too as well as the Prieſts?

                  <p>Well this is but a ſmall matter to talk of. But I can never forgive the Sanctimonious Brotherhood, for all the miſchief they have done to Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by burying its pure and divine Light in ſuch a Load of Ceremonious Trumpery. If it were not for theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of Prieſtcraft, a Man might do his duty as far as nature directs, with all the eaſe imaginable. If a Man would but take care to do what unprejudiced nature prompts him to, not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge her with more than ſhe craves, nor to check her in her juſt deſires, and to have as great and auguſt thoughts as he can of the Deity; he might perform the whole buſineſs of Religion to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes. All the ceremonious foppery which does ſo peſter Mankind, is owing to the Prieſts contrivance, who would not have got ſo much by the free, eaſy directions of nature, as they do by long Catalogues of Articles of Faith, and a fine Pageant-like-Raree-ſhow worſhip. For my money give me good old, Pure, natural Religion, which was in <hi>diebus illis. In pious times e'er Prieſtcraft did begin. Before,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> or only in the Brains of the Gentlemen of your way. For your notion of natural Religion is ſo far from being Gods Law, or a Rule of Mankind, that it was never dreamt of, till Mr <hi>Hobbs</hi> would make his viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualities the rule of humane Actions, and ſome of his Diſciples had improved further upon him ſince. 'Tis true, I am for that natural Religion, which is the dictates of right reaſon, as much as any one; but your natural Religion is the corrupt inclination of a depraved will and diſorderly Paſſions, made out of Fear, Pride, Luſt, and a Selfiſh humour. Men of theſe Principles are Temperate, only for fear of the ſickneſs of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch, or in hopes to live as long as the Old Gentleman of <hi>Malmeſbury.</hi> They forbear to kill, or rob their Friend, for fear of the animadverſion of the Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, or Common-wealth; or that they may not incurr the danger of being hanged, or loſing their reputation. Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery indeed may be a little againſt the Pact we enter'd into, when we retired from a State of Nature; but moderate Whoring is as innocent, as Eating, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Sleeping. And now what a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Idea of natural Religion is this, for Men thus to Philoſophize themſelves
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:172675:19"/>
into Beaſts, and to call that pure Nature which is the worſt ſort of Brutality? It cannot be denied, but that we have ſome diſorderly affections within, which are apt to prompt us to ſuch Actions; but we have before ſhewn, that theſe Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites have received an original deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which has been the Opinion of all wiſe Men; and beſides, in the midſt of this Tumult of unruly Paſſions, we ſtill find a right reaſon within us, diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe irregular Tendencies, and a Conſcience checking us for the ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them. And now let any one judge which has the juſteſt claim to the Title of natural Religion and the unblameable practice of Mankind; thoſe wiſe dictates of reaſon which reſtrain theſe deſires, or the mad Paſſions themſelves. And yet when all comes to all, your Infidel Sparks after all their cry for natural Religion, and pure uncorrupted nature, mean no more by it, than uncontrouled ſenſuality. Which is ſo vile an end for a Man to propoſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that it reflects a diſgrace upon our common Reaſon; and at laſt, let him gain as much of it as he can, he will never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive that way to the happineſs of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Beaſt.

                  <p>I beſeech you, <hi>Credentius,</hi> not ſo ſevere. All we Infidels are not ſuch Hogs as you would make us; for ſome of us are better principled than this comes to. Such Men as you deſcribe are our Hereticks, as I may call them; though they pretend to natural Religion they have highly corrupted it, and almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd it. But we Orthodox Unbelievers have our Tenets fixed upon a ſounder Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and take nothing up for natural Religion, which is not the Reſult of right reaſoning, and grounded upon the clear principles of natural Light. For this is the ſole Rule which God has given us to walk by; not that Men like theſe Libertines ſhould miſtake the cravings of their Irregular Appetites for the Law of nature, but to govern them by it. For I ſuppoſe God to have given us theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites not to be Law to our actions, but as a <hi>ſubject</hi> to exerciſe our obedience to this Law of God, or Nature upon; ſo that then we are ſaid to act according to the Law of Nature, when we follow thoſe dictates which every ones unbyaſſed reaſon affords him, even in oppoſition to theſe irregular Tendencies of our vitiated Appetites. This is that noble Rule which alone, if followed, will make a Man Wiſe, and Vertuous, and Happy. Under

                  <p>I find you are continually harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Prieſts being the Authors of all the ceremonious parts of Religion, and particularly Sacrifice; and that the World was a conſiderable time without either Prieſts or Sacrifice under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of pure natural Religion, and that the Prieſthood was but of late date, and crept into the World by impoſing upon the People pompous Ceremonies.

                  <p n="1">1.

duty; and though they be very negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of Inſtruction, yet by hearing their Duty ſo continually inculcated ſomething ſticks at laſt, even in the worſt Minds, and keeps them from being ſo profligately wicked as they would otherways be: 'Tis true indeed, 'tis poſſible ſome Men may live good lives without a Prieſthood, or Clergy to inſtruct them; and ſo 'tis poſſible to blunder out a ſtrange way in the dark; but all Men muſt allow 'tis more eaſily gone with an experienced Guide. But beſides, I have one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove the Uſefullneſs, of a Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or Miniſtery, that will reach you Gentlemen that allow no Revelation. All you Theiſts grant to pray to God is a Part of Natural Religion, and that in publick too upon ſpecial occaſions, as to deprecate God's Vengeance in publick Calamities, and to thank him for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick mercies, and the like. Now you would not have all the People at Church to be charming and gabling together e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one his own Prayer, but for decency and Order ſake one ought to ſpeak for the reſt, to whom if the Publick allow any thing for his pains, then you have what we call a Prieſthood or Clergy.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:172675:22"/>
your own Hypotheſis by making them uſeleſs and inſignificant. A good and conſcientious Clergy-man that makes it his buſineſs to incourage Piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, will do more good than a hundred <hi>Tully's</hi> and <hi>Seneca's;</hi> and the World would be well hope up, if they had no other Guides in Morality, than ſome of thoſe wiſe ſober Gentlemen as you call them, many of which continue lewd as long as they can, and in their old Age turn Moral-mongers when they can be vitious no longer. But to go on.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

I know not what ſecret Hiſtories your Gentlemen may have of the Golden Age, but as for us dull Believers, we cann't ſee one word in all the ancient Books we meet withal, that gives us the leaſt hint of ſuch a naked natural Religion as you ſpeak of. If we have recourſe to the Poets, to whom we are beholden for all that is known of theſe Golden Ages, when theſe brave men lived; they make Religion as Ritual as it is now; and altogether as full of Sacrifices and Revelations.

It was formerly the current Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Schools that theſe moral no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices were Idea's connate with the Soul, and in a certain manner inſcribed upon it. But it is very odd to think, how ſuch propoſitions as theſe, <hi>Parents are to be honoured, Friends are to be aſſiſted, The Marriage-Bed to be undefiled, Whoredom and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:172675:26"/>
Drunkenneſs avoided;</hi> 'tis odd to think, I ſay, how that theſe propoſitions which are the complication of ſo many diſtinct and ſimple Idea's which we are ſure are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attained by experience and reaſon, ſhould yet be aſſerted to come into the mind by ſuch an unaccountable way as this of Inſcription. But ſaying no more is meant by this Inſcription, than a kind of natural and univerſal Inſpiration of the Soul, or Imbution of it with theſe moral Principles; this is altogether unagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Souls of Children, Ideots, and ſome very barbarous People, who we are certain do want moſt of theſe moral notions. So that of late this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Innate Ideas</hi> has been generally exploded by learned men and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken up, it may be ſubject to as many difficulties, which attributes the origin of theſe moral notions to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of right reaſon, aſſerting that the generality of Men having the uſe of reaſon, and few of them being ſo brutiſh but in their life Time they apply their minds to the conſideration of theſe moral Duties, and ſo by the agreeableneſs of them to the Social Life of Mankind, do eaſily infer the obligation of them. And ſo the <hi>Law natural</hi> is by this explication nothing elſe, but a Scheme of Vertues and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:172675:27"/>
Vices which every Man, by his own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Experience, has found out to be ſuch from their agreeableneſs and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeableneſs to Society, and to the ends Man is deſigned for. Thus I am ſuppoſed to come to know, that to rob my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is unlawful, becauſe this is contrary to thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">Vid.

Now there is many a poor honeſt <hi>Indian</hi> who knows it is his duty not to ſteal, as well as e'er a <hi>Hobb's,</hi> or <hi>Puffendorff</hi> of them all; and yet he never in his Life ſo much as dreamt of <hi>Pacts,</hi> or <hi>Fides Data,</hi> or <hi>Occupation.</hi> Suppoſe I bargain with an honeſt <hi>Virginian</hi> for a Pipe of Tobacco, and a Bottle of Sack, to watch my Tent, whilſt I ſleep, from Wild Beaſts, or Banditti's; now when he might cut my Throat, and run away with all that I have, what is the reaſon that the poor Fellow ſtays walking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as truſtfully with his Bow and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as if he were ſet Centinal by a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that would hang him for running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?

Why, ſay moſt of our natural Religion-Men, by frequent exerciſe of his reaſon and thinking, he has come to the knowledge of the horridneſs of the Sin of Murder, and the Baſeneſs of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs. But then who can ever think that this poor ignorant wretch ſhould ever have given himſelf to ſuch grave and Philoſophick Diſquiſitions; that he ſhould ever have conſidered that to kill a rational Creature was to deface the Image of the All-wiſe Deity, to uſurp a barbarous power over one naturally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with himſelf, and to take away that Life which mutual Friendſhip obliged to protect; that to violate a given Faith was a baſeneſs beneath the dignity of a Rational Man, and which if univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally practiſed would deſtroy all Society out of the World. No certainly, the poor <hi>Indian</hi> never troubled his Head with theſe matters; his thoughts in his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger days run all upon Hunting, and Swimming, and loving, and afterwards to get good ſtore of Progg for his Wives and Children; but he never thought a word of theſe Rationale's of Morality which were invented by men of a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Education and buſy Thoughts. How came then this poor fellow to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe moral Duties? Why truly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:172675:28"/>
I can conceive no other way than by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; his Father taught them him, and his Grand-Father his Father, and ſo up to <hi>Adam,</hi> the common Parent of us all; who had them firſt from God-Almighty as the univerſal Laws that all his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould be governed by. Nor is it any objection againſt this Opinion, that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition does not ſeem to ſome ſo proper a means to convey Morality by to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind becauſe of its liableneſs to Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that it would have been more ſenſibly vitiated than we find it is, had it deſcended by this Method: For tho' Relations of matters of Fact, Ancient Cuſtoms, and difficult Articles of Faith, may ſuffer much by being conveyed this way, becauſe the Underſtandings of Men cannot be ſuppoſed to have a clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of theſe things upon the firſt propoſal, and ſo may be liable to miſtake them, which muſt occaſion very great alterations in ſuch a number of Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but theſe plain Rules of Morality, ſuch as <hi>Worſhip God, Honour thy Parents, thou ſhalt do no Murder, thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> &amp;c. are ſo natural to the underſtanding, ſo eaſy to be embraced by it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon propoſal to be ſo extreamly uſeful to Mankind, that they muſt be aſſented to and can never be miſtaken or
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:172675:28"/>
forgot. The ſame is the caſe of theſe Moral Rules, as of very early and uſeful Inventions, ſuch as Spinning, Weaving, Arching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are conveyed to all the World, not by being written in Books, or in Mans Hearts, but by the handing down from one to another for ſeveral thouſand years together. Now unleſs it was the general Opinion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that this was the ordinary way of conveying the Rules of Morality to their Poſterity, to what purpoſe ſhould they take ſo much pains in inſtructing their Children as we find men have done in all Ages, and in all Countries. But if Morality were inſcribed on Mens Hearts, and ſo were all one as if it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in their nature; Parents might with as much Wiſdom pretend to teach their Children to eat and drink, to love their Children, and deſire a propagation of their Species, which they cannot but do; or if theſe moral Duties were the neceſſary and unavoidable, deductions of Reaſon, it would be as ſimple to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to learn them the rules of Vertue as to teach them that one and one make two. And it is further particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and which may ſerve as a good proof of what has been ſaid, we find the Parents are commanded by God,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:172675:29"/>
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6. to teach their Children theſe Moral Duties. For after the recital of the Ten Commandments. (<hi>viz.</hi> the Moral Law) He adds, <hi>And theſe words which I command thee this day ſhall be in thy heart; and thou ſhalt teach them diligently to thy Children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thy Houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi> And 'tis yet further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that what <hi>Moſes</hi> here ſays, <hi>ſhall be in</hi> the Jews <hi>hearts,</hi> the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. was <hi>written in</hi> the Gentiles <hi>Hearts;</hi> So that unleſs there can be a ſubſtantial Difference evinced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>being in the heart</hi> and <hi>being written</hi> there, all the Doctrine of inſcribed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions falls to the ground. And I am ſure there is no reaſon why God ſhould write Moral Laws in the groſs and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe in the Gentiles Hearts, and put them into the Jews by the ordinary way of teaching and inſtruction.</p>

And this your Divines are aware of well enough, when they are forced now and then to bring in a ſhred, or two of the ancient Learning, to add a poignancy to their dull Diſcourſes of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, to keep the folk from ſleeping; and I obſerve generally an Auditory of a ſudden to look brisk upon <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> when they have been nodding over <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> And truly there is good reaſon for it, for their Books and ſayings afford us ſuch admirable Lectures of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, in them we may ſee the duty of Mankind ſet out ſo fully and exactly, and in ſuch charming ſtrains of Eloquence, that all your inſpired Authors, as you call
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:172675:36"/>
them, look very poor things to them. Now who can blame me for ſtanding up for Natural Religion, when you ſee it could raiſe theſe Philoſophical Minds to ſuch a noble height, as Revelation can never pretend to? I cannot read a piece of <hi>Seneca,</hi> or <hi>Plutarch,</hi> or any of thoſe excellent Philoſophers, but methinks, my Soul is warm'd with the braveneſs of the thoughts, and I am at the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of, and in Love with my Duty. And I doubt not but had I liv'd in thoſe times to have made the obſervation, I might have perceived that the Lectures and Examples of theſe admirable Men had conſiderable influence upon the Lives of the common People; at leaſt, I am ſure, there was force enough in their Doctrine to make them compleatly good. <hi>Sit anima mea cum animis Philoſophorum;</hi> and in another ſtate, let me but conſort with the <hi>Plato</hi>'s and <hi>Zeno</hi>'s, and I ſhall never envy your Armies of Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</p>

State of thoſe good Heathen that have lived up to the Light of their reaſon; I know they are to ſtand or fall by the judgment of a merciful God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for my part I am always inclined to hope very well of them. But this I am ſure of, that the Morality of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſophers was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a compleat rule of Morals, that it was very erroneous, both as it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Nature of God and the notion of Vertue; and that it was ſo far from having any influence upon the Lives of the Commonalty, that for the moſt part it had little or none upon their own. As for the good language and handſom thought, that was the Talent and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Study of thoſe Ages; but then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that which ſullied all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and ſpoil'd the beſt things they did, or ſaid, was, that Pride and vain glory, which was common to all of them, and which all their words and actions were bottomed upon. For I will make it appear to you, <hi>Philologus,</hi>
                  </p>

I remember, calls a Philoſopher <hi>the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal of Glory,</hi> and if one conſiders the generality of their Writings and Practice, one ſhall find he had great reaſon for it.

                     <hi>Vult plane virtus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norem: nec eſt vertutis ulla alia merces.

For what other account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides gaining glory and a name in the World, can be given of their hatching ſo many different Principles, both in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiology and Morality, but only to be taken notice of for inventing ſomething ſingular and remarkable? What was it but this vain ambition that put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch affected habits which many of them are reported to have worn, upon ſuch ſingular Diet and odd actions which the Writers of their Lives relate of them? If they had deſign'd to do as much good as they could by their Philoſophy, they would have communicated it to all; but inſtead of this, they taught it only to a ſelect number of Men that were their own Diſciples, and this oftentimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an engagement of ſecreſy, or in a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:172675:38"/>
way of Cant which was unintelligible to all others. So that all theſe noble rules of Morality which would have made the World ſo happy, were confined to a few Gentlemen only, that could afford Time and Money to get ſuch Philoſophical Tutours; but for the reſt of the World, for all the Philoſophers, they muſt be content to live like Beaſts ſtill.</p>

Mankind, and put no body of all the vaſt ſwarms in the Gentile World in hopes of Salvation, but only ſome few Chriſtians for their believing in Jeſus Chriſt. God Almighty I am ſure is a kind and merciful Father, and contrives the greateſt good for all his Creatures, which they are capable of; and therefore whereas all the Gentile Nations have Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, and are capable of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Felicity, it can never be ſuppoſed, but that in this World they are in the way to Salvation, and that the Law that is given them, which can be none but the Natural one, is ſufficient to attain it by: So that if this be ſufficient to carry them to Heaven, you may banter what you pleaſe about the imperfection of it. For my part I am for going thither the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way, and that is by Natural Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I am not for coaſting about to take in Ceremonies and long Articles of Faith to no purpoſe. Either God Almighty has damned all the Heathen World, that practiſed Natural Religion, which none but a Popiſh or a Calviniſtical cruelty can aſſert; or I, who am for the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, am in as comfortable a way of Salvation, as e'er a Goſpeller of you all.</p>

But the Perſons of your way, after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſeed of Gods word, have tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon it; you have ſeen the light of the Goſpel, and ſhut your Eyes upon it; you have turned Renegado's to your bleſſed Redeemer, and perfidiouſly deſerted his Inſtitution, which in your Baptiſm you ſwore to live and die under. So that you are ſtrangely miſtaken, to think that your condition hereafter will be as good as the old Pagans. Your caſes are as wide, as thoſe of Foreigners and Domeſtick Rebels, in a Civil War; their Obedience was not expected by Chriſt, but you have traiterouſly deſerted him, and fought againſt him, contrary to your ſworn Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance.

To be <hi>ſaved,</hi> or to partake of whatſoever Glories are comprehended under that name, is the peculiar Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of us Chriſtians; for the Scripture ſays plainly, <hi>there is no other name given under Heaven, by which we may expect Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but only the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; that no man cometh to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but by him; that God added to the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved,</hi> and the like.

For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the true God who created Heaven and Earth, and all the Creatures comprehended therein, and who has endowed them with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and inclinations ſo various, had it pleaſed him, when he gave Men Bodies and Souls alike, he could have infuſed into them the ſame ſentiments of the Religion they were to profeſs, and have united all Nations under one Law. But 'tis obvious, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence permits variety of Sects and Opinions, becauſe God takes as much pleaſure to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored with different Forms of Worſhip and Ceremonies, as to be glorifyed by the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diverſity of his Creatures, whoſe various Beauties ſet forth his Infinite Power.</hi> So that in ſhort, <hi>Credentius,</hi> I think it every Man's duty to comply with the Religion eſtabliſhed in his Country, whatever his private thoughts may be concerning it, and that God-Almighty is ſatisfied with

the inward worſhip of ones mind, though for peace ſake he complies with an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous outward one.

For many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions are ſo made up of Ceremonious Foppery, that Morality is little taken notice of in them; and ſome retain ſuch Dangerous Errours and Faults in their Doctrine and Worſhip, that there is no Communion with them, without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of moral Honeſty, or intrenching upon the dictates of Natural Religion.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:172675:55"/>
For if God have revealed his Will by the command of any particular Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as he has done to Jews and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, then all other Religions do of courſe fall to the ground. Well, but God permits theſe different Religions, by his not ordering all Men to be of the ſame Sentiments in Religion; whereas he might as eaſily have done this, as to have made their Bodies and Souls alike. But is God's permiſſion a ſign of his good liking? Why then by the ſame rule all the villanies which are committed in the World are well pleaſing to him, becauſe they cannot be done but by his permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Beſides, 'tis very true on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, That God might have infuſed into all Men the ſame Sentiments of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Vice, and have made all Men good alike; but 'tis plain, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the greateſt number of Men to be vicious, which is therefore an evident ſign that he does not concern himſelf about Vertue and Vice, and therefore 'tis a wonder that Men ſhould ſhew ſuch a concern about Morality, which God himſelf by this permiſſion does ſeem to have little regard to.

Revealed; and therefore you Theiſts ought to have a care, how you make uſe of it, for you thereby put a Weapon into the Atheiſt's hands, and plainly give up your cauſe to him. But on the other ſide, you ought to conſider, that as God's permiſſion of Vice is no ſign of his liking it, he having other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways declared his will by giving to all Men a Law of Vertue; ſo his tolerating ſo many falſe Religions, does not evince his Approbation of them, when he has manifeſtly declared his will how he will be worſhiped, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. This is that way which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has ſet out for us to walk in, and to go in any other road is but wandering.</p>

                  <p>I think, Sir, we have talked enough about Natural Religion, and therefore, Sir, if you will oblige me with your Thoughts concerning that Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:172675:56"/>
one which is owned by Chriſtians, and will give me ſatisfaction as to ſome ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I have conceived concerning it, it will be a very agreeable favour. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I am not very averſe to think, that there is a great defect generally in Man's reaſoning concerning religious matters, and Men's Thoughts do very much vary therein, ſo that it is not a difficult ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſuppoſe that the gracious Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who had compaſſion upon all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, has contrived a way more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to guide fluctuating Nature in ſuch momentous concerns, and may have been pleaſed ſometimes to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened Men with a Ray or two of his Wiſdom, from above, by revelation of ſome divine Truths. But then how ſhall we come to know, to whom he has particularly vouchſafed this favour? What marks of Grace ſhall we go by, to diſtinguiſh who are Heavens darling Favourites, that are bleſſed with ſuch obliging manifeſtations? The Jews and Chriſtians indeed pretend to it, but why not the Turks and Tartars as well as they? But if a bold pretence to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, be an Argument for it, every little Hedge-Sect of Idolaters in <hi>India</hi> ſhall bid as fair for Inſpiration, as e'er a Jew or Chriſtian of you all. And in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:172675:57"/>
truth if there be any ſuch thing as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, for ought as I know, all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Religions in the World may be (to uſe the Apoſtle's phraſe) but <hi>diverſity of gifts of the ſame ſpirit.</hi> The <hi>Chineſe</hi> may have the ſame Divine Revelation to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip their <hi>Tanquam</hi> and <hi>Teiquam,</hi> as we have to worſhip Jeſus Chriſt. The <hi>Banians</hi> and <hi>Bramins</hi> the Prieſts in <hi>India,</hi> may have the ſame plea for all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions they claim for their Deities there, and ſo may the <hi>Japoneſe</hi> for their famous Gods <hi>Fotoques</hi> and <hi>Games,</hi> as the <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> for the rites paid to their <hi>Virachoca.</hi> Nor does my conjecture ſtand ſingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but I have your own ſacred Writings to back me in it. For there are many Texts of Scripture, which ſeem plainly to affirm, that God-Almighty has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his Will by a Poſitive Inſtitution to the Gentile World, whom you look down with ſo much contempt upon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of your ſuperabundant pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. For <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>Melchiſedeck was King of Jeruſalem, and Prieſt of the moſt high God;</hi> and that he <hi>bleſſed Abraham,</hi> which was a principal Office of the Moſaical Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood (<hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23.) and that <hi>Abraham</hi> pay'd Tithes to him of his Spoils. From whence it is plain, That God had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:172675:57"/>
Inſtitution before the Jews or their Forefather <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, and that when <hi>Abraham</hi> is commended for keeping God's <hi>commandments, and ſtatutes, and Laws, Gen.</hi> 26.5. it is only theſe poſitive injunctions in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> which <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was the Prieſt, or Prophet, or Diſpenſer of. So <hi>Malachi</hi> 1.10. <hi>Who is there among you that would ſhut the doors of my Temple, that fire ſhould not be kindled upon mine Altar. For from the riſing of the Sun unto the going down thereof, my name ſhall be great among the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and in every place Incenſe ſhall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering, for my name ſhall be great among the heathen, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> By which words it is plain, That at that time the Prophet did not think the Jews dearer to God than other People, and that the Heathens worſhip was as acceptable to him as theirs. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.18. <hi>The Lord is nigh to all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in Truth.</hi> And in the ſame <hi>Pſalm v.</hi> 9. it is ſaid <hi>God is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works.</hi> So God himſelf gives a Teſtimony of <hi>Job</hi> a Gentile, that <hi>there was none like him in the Earth, a perfect and an upright Man,</hi> Job 1.8. So <hi>Jonas</hi> ſaid he determined to flee to <hi>Tarſus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:172675:58"/>
he knew God to be a gracious and merciful God,</hi> Jon. 4.2. and who would therefore pardon even the Gentile <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</hi> Beſides, we read in Scripture that ſeveral uncircumciſed Gentiles had the gift even of Prophecy, as <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abimelech,</hi> and <hi>Balaam.</hi> Nay ſeveral of the Jewiſh Prophets propheſy for the uſe of the Gentiles, <hi>Ezechiel</hi> propheſies to all the Nations then known. <hi>Obadiah</hi> propheſies only for the Children of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> and <hi>Jonas</hi> principally for the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites; Iſaias</hi> foretells the calamities and deliverance of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> Iſ. 19.19. and the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> is call'd expreſly a Prophet of the Nations or <hi>Gentiles: Before thou cameſt out of the Womb, I ſanctified thee, and I ordained thee a Prophet unto the Nations,</hi> Jer. 1.5. and Chap. 48.31. <hi>he ſays he will howl for Moab, he will cry out for Moab:</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 36. <hi>My heart ſhall ſound for Moab like Pipes,</hi> &amp;c. which pathetick expreſſions ſhew that he was ſent by God a Prophet, as well for the Gentile Moabites as the Jews. But as for the Prophecy of <hi>Balaam,</hi> that is ſo expreſs, that all the <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> Prophets cannot pretend more to the Spirit of Prophecy, than this one Gentile Seer. So that, <hi>Credentius,</hi> you may make what brags you pleaſe of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:172675:58"/>
Revelations, but if you do not own old <hi>Balaam,</hi> as much a Heathen as he was, to be a very good Prophet, you will want one of the moſt conſiderable proofs of Chriſtianity. Nay the Scripture gives this Man all the Characters of a Prophetick ſpirit. <hi>He hath ſaid who heard the words of God, who ſaw the Viſion of the Almighty, falling into a Trance, but having his Eyes open,</hi> Numb. 24.4. Now methinks it is a little unfair, for you, to make ſuch an outcry about God's particular Favour to you by Revelation, when thoſe very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Scriptures themſelves, which you make ſuch brags of, allow it to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then as well as you.</p>

And when <hi>Spinoſa</hi> contends ſo mightily for it, I fancy it muſt be only an humorſom Paradox of that odd Man, and not his ſetled Opinion; or at leaſt the effect of a Pique he had conceived againſt the Jews, and ſo was reſolved to ſet them upon the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:172675:59"/>

                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">Becauſe Idolatrous.</note>1. That moſt of the Religions in the World are Idolatrous. Now it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſuppoſe, that God by a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould command Men to do that which all wiſe Men would be aſhamed to do: to fall down before Stocks and ſtones, to worſhip the Sun and the Moon, ſenſeleſs, inanimate Creatures, and to adore dead Men, and Tyrannical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; or even Herbs, or Beaſts. Now though we ſhould ſuppoſe, that God was in no ways jealous of his honour, and that it was indifferent to him whatſoever Thing we worſhipped, yet as he is the God of <hi>Truth,</hi> 'tis impoſſible he ſhould command a falſe worſhip, or inſtruct People in paying devotion to things as Gods, which are only mean and perhaps wicked Creatures. Now the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Unchriſtian World, are and have been ſuch Idolaters; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make God to have revealed to them their ſuperſtitions, is to make God to repreſent himſelf ſuch as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to be; to be delighted in a worſhip which is falſe and wicked, and to be himſelf the Chief Author of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:172675:59"/>
the Impoſture; which is ſo horrid, as no body will contend for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Other Unchriſtian Nations that are not Idolaters (as chiefly the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans) profeſs a Religion which allows Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality,<note place="margin">Immoral.</note> the Founder whereof was rather poſſeſſed by the Devil, than inſpired by God. A Lewd debauched Fanatical Wretch, that lived by Rapine and Murder, and ſpent his days in Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Adulteries and Sodomies. Now his Religion allows its followers to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it by the blood of the oppoſers, and by all manner of cruelty and barbarity againſt Men of other perſwaſions. It allows Concubinacy and Whoredom, and even Sodomy it ſelf; and the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it propoſes in another World, are ſuch infamous Luſt, as a good Man would be aſhamed to think of in this. 3. As for your Inſtances out of Scripture,<note place="margin">Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck.</note> becauſe you ſhould not too much inſult over us, as having wounded us with our own Weapons, will you be pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this anſwer to the firſt, That <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck</hi> is no proof of a Revelation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles, more than of that Univerſal Revelation, which was given by <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> to all Mankind; and upon which, as was ſhewn before, what is generally called Natural Religion, is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:172675:60"/>
grounded upon. For though <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> was no Jew, as not deſcending from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> yet he was not properly a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, eſpecially ſuch a one as is uſually underſtood by the word, <hi>viz.</hi> one that has degenerated from the ancient and true Religion, into an idolatrous ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. For <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was a true and Orthodox Member of the ancient <hi>Noa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical</hi> Church, and no ways tinctured with the prevailing Idolatrous Vice of thoſe Ages, but in the midſt of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty defection to falſe Gods and Idols, was a <hi>Prieſt of the moſt high God.</hi> So that 'tis a great miſtake to ſay, That God had a Prieſthood among the Gentiles, from the Inſtance of <hi>Melchiſedeck;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſay <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was no Gentile, but a conſtant Perſeverer in God's Church, from which the Gentiles had even at that time made a defection; he kept up to the <hi>Noachical</hi> Precepts, which the Gentiles round him had neglected. But if in ſtrict ſpeaking you will have him a Gentile, becauſe he was not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, it does not from hence follow, that God had an inſtituted Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Nations, diſtinctly inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the Jewiſh was. For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does not give us a particular account who this <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was: the Jews
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:172675:60"/>
will have him to be <hi>Shem</hi> the Eldeſt Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> becauſe perhaps they would allow no body elſe to be greater than their Father <hi>Abraham</hi> to bleſs him; but though this does well enough agree with the Age of <hi>Shem,</hi> who lived till after <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time; yet it is not probable that <hi>Shem</hi> dwelt in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was the Seat of <hi>Cham</hi>'s Poſterity. But be he <hi>Shem,</hi> or any one elſe, and though he were a Worſhipper of the true God, yet he was ſo only upon the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the old Revelation made to <hi>Noah,</hi> which was common to all the World with him: he had not any particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations afforded him, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> to found a new Church upon; neither he nor his People had any ſuch Favour vouchſafed them, as to have the <hi>Oracles of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them,</hi> as the Jews had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. He was a Prieſt as he was the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a Family in the old Patriarchal way, and not by any poſitive Inſtitution among the Gentiles; and ſo bleſſed <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> who communicated with him in the Divine worſhip whilſt he did officiate, as he might have done with <hi>Abraham</hi> in ſuch an Euchariſtical, or any other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. 4. As for that Text of <hi>Malachi,</hi> where it is ſaid, that <hi>God's name ſhall be great among the Gentiles;</hi> (though <hi>Spinoſa</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:172675:61"/>
tranſlates, <hi>it is great among the Gentiles,</hi> when the Verb is wanting in the Hebrew, which is wrong, for the Book is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick, and ſpeaks of futures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be rendered <hi>ſhall be</hi>) this does by no means ſet the Gentiles at that time on a Level with the Jews, but is a remarkable Prophecy of the Kingdom of the Meſſias, when the Partition-Wall ſhould be taken away, and God ſhould have one Church made up both of Jews and Gentiles. 5. As to thoſe places of the Pſalmiſt, that <hi>God's tender mercies are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all his works;</hi> and that <hi>God is nigh unto all them that call upon him:</hi> It is the deſign of the Pſalmiſt to ſhew forth God's ſuperlative goodneſs in this Pſalm, and therefore among the reſt of God's Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, does praiſe him for his merciful Providence over his Creatures, <hi>his tender mercies are over all his works.</hi> And ſo his <hi>being nigh unto all them that call upon him,</hi> does not in the leaſt denote any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular divine Inſtitution like the Jewiſh Revelation among the Heathen, but is only in general, an Aſſertion of God's Univerſal Love to Mankind, and his willingneſs to aſſiſt them, which no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man can deny. 6. As for your Inſtance in <hi>Job, that he was a good Man and acceptable to God;</hi> why, ſo were all the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:172675:61"/>
good Patriarchs before the Law, or the Circumciſion; nay though we ſhould grant that God ſpake by Revelation to this good Man, as it may appear from <hi>Chap.</hi> 38.1. yet it does not follow, that all the Idolatrous Heathen afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſame favour. For before the Law, and in other Nations, where the Law was not received, Morality to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the eaſy <hi>Noachical</hi> precepts, were the Rule of their Duty; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore until they had forfeited this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the divine favour, by the enormity of their Lives, and their devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the True worſhip, they had as good a Title to the Inſpiration of God, whenever he ſhould pleaſe to afford it them, as the Jews had after their Church was inſtituted. 7. But as for what you alledge, that <hi>Jonah</hi> was only an <hi>Ethnick</hi> Prophet, I think by your favour, that is a great miſtake. For <hi>Jonah</hi> was principally a Prophet to the Jews, and propheſied under <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſecond, the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as is plain from the 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> where it is ſaid, that <hi>Jeroboam reſtored the coaſt of Iſrael from the entering in of Hameth unto the Sea of the Plain, according unto the word of the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which he ſpake by the hand of his ſervant Jonah, the Son
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:172675:62"/>
of Amittai, the Prophet, which was of Gath-hepher.</hi> Whether or no that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy which is there referred to were ever written or no, or whether it was only verbal, we cannot now determine, there being nothing like it in our Canon of Scripture; but it is from hence very evident, that <hi>Jonas</hi> was a Prophet origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to the Jews. That he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſent to the Gentiles, was a great favour indeed to that Heathen City of <hi>Niniveh;</hi> but then he had firſt Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and when they had profited little or nothing by it, he like Chriſt and his Apoſtles, turned to the Gentiles. 8. As for your exceptions from <hi>Enoch, Noah,</hi> &amp;c. they lived before the general corruption by Idolatry, and therefore it is but reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that they living up to the old true Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal Religion, might partake of the divine Revelation as well as the Jews. And the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi>'s Prophecy is wholly taken up in ſhewing God's judgments upon the Jews, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to bring them to a true ſenſe of their Sins; only a Chapter or two are interpoſed to foretel God's Vengeance likewiſe upon their Enemies, whoſe wickedneſs God's All-wiſe Providence had made uſe of to be a ſcourge for the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:172675:62"/>
Sins of his People. And ſo for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> their bemoaning the Calamities of the Heathens of <hi>Jazer</hi> and <hi>Edom,</hi> that is not a prophecy on their behalf, but only is a lively Hypotypoſis, or Poetical Deſcription of the ſad Miſeries which thoſe People ſhould undergo, to hearten up the Jews in their afflictions when they ſhould underſtand, that God would lay ſuch heavy burdens upon their Enemies; and to ſhew them that they had no reaſon to forſake the true Religion, when they ſhould ſee that the Heathens underwent as ſevere judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as they. 9. And ſo again as to the Prophecy of <hi>Obadiah,</hi> whom you aſſert to have been a Prophet only to the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> he was a Prophet only to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and for ought appears to the contrary, originally of Jewiſh extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for I think little credit is to be given to the Jewiſh Authors, who would make him an <hi>Edomitiſh</hi> Proſelyte. But that <hi>Obadiah</hi> was a Prophet to the Jews only, is evident by the whole tenour of this ſhort Prophecy, where firſt are denounced God's ſevere judgments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Edomites</hi> the Enemies of the Jews, and his vengeance for their Pride and Inſolence, and afterwards the Jews delivery from them, and conqueſt over
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:172675:63"/>
them. <hi>But upon mount Sion ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and Jacob ſhall poſſeſs their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And the houſe of Jacob ſhall be a fire, and the houſe Joſeph a Flame, and the houſe of Eſau for Stubble, and they ſhall kindle in them, and devour them, and there ſhall not be any of the houſe of Eſau; for the Lord hath ſpoken it,</hi> v. 17, 18. Now does this look like an <hi>Edomitiſh</hi> Prophet? But this is juſt as <hi>Spinoſa</hi> and <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and the Devil are uſed to quote Scripture. 10. The moſt conſiderable Inſtance is that of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who may ſeem to be an <hi>Ethnick</hi> Prophet, by his living in a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Country, and his being at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a Heathen King, and by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting ſo plainly ſuch remarkable Events, which afterwards ſo punctually came to paſs; as the greatneſs of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the deſtruction of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanitiſh</hi> Nations, and the coming of the Meſſias. But then altho' this be true, yet it does not from hence follow, that the gift of Prophecy was common to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as well as to the Jews, from this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Becauſe this Prophecy was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned only for the benefit of the Jewiſh Nation, and although it was pronounced by the mouth, of a Heathen Man, yet the deſign and purpoſe of it was for the good of the Jews; and truly it was but
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:172675:63"/>
a ſmall priviledge of the Heathen to have one of them to pronounce a Prophecy of God only in favour of the Jews, and that too for the utter Extirpation of themſelves. So that for ought I ſee in this Inſtance, <hi>Baalam</hi>'s Aſs would be as good a one altogether to prove, That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration is common to Brutes too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God once made uſe of his mouth, to confute his Maſter's folly. 11. Well but <hi>Baalam,</hi> you ſay, was a true and accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prophet, and not made uſe of only by God upon this extraordinary exigence. I am afraid this is an aſſertion which cannot be ſo eaſily made out as ſaid, and indeed the contrary thereof may be proved by the context. For firſt he cannot be a true Prophet of God, becauſe he made uſe of unlawful Arts, and as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays, <hi>fought for inchantments,</hi> Cap. 24. 1. and what we from the Vulgar, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <hi>the rewards of divination,</hi> are in the original <hi>only divinations</hi> (i. e.) inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of divination, conjuring Books, Wands, or the like. And ſecondly he is called <hi>Koſem,</hi> a Diviner, or Sorcerer, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 13.22. Which word has always an ill Character fixt on it in Scripture, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Spinoſa</hi> maintains the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, though without any Inſtance of it. I have carefully examined all the words
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:172675:64"/>
that I find in Scripture which come from this root, and I do not find any, unleſs by way of Metaphor, but carry an ill ſenſe, and ſignify unlawful knowledge of future things; or a lying pretended one; and as for thoſe places of the Prophets, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 24.25. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.14. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 13.7, and 23. <hi>Micah</hi> 3.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where they may ſeem to ſignify ſimple Prophecy, yet it will be manifeſt by cloſely conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the places, that they are only <hi>harder words</hi> to characteriſe the falſe prophecies of ſome lying Prophets, among the Jews; as if I ſhould call an Aſtrologer a Gypſy, or a Conjurer, names which carry more vulgar diſrepute and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in them. I know but two places in Scripture where they are uſed in a good ſenſe: the firſt is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.10. A <hi>divining ſentence,</hi> or <hi>divination</hi> (not as we tranſlate it, too far from the original words a <hi>divine ſentence) is in the Lips of the King, and his mouth tranſgreſſeth not in judgment.</hi> That is, the King is a wiſe ſagacious Man in his judicial deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, makes ſhrewd conjectures from outward appearance to diſcover Mens inward Intentions, and by that ſort of Political divination awards judgment accordingly. The ſecond is, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 32. where it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord doth take away from

                  <p>I think, <hi>Philologus,</hi> you are not a little miſtaken in Arguing after this manner. For it does not appear from Scripture, that <hi>Balaam,</hi> did endeavour to ſeek after <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or the true God, when he deſigned to make enquiry after the future fate of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> upon <hi>Balack</hi>'s requeſt, but only after <hi>Baal,</hi> or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſe Deity of the <hi>Moabites.</hi> That the ſearch made to him is ſaid to be made to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is, becauſe <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh name for God, which no doubt in the <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> Language was <hi>Baal,</hi> or ſome ſuch like name; which <hi>Moſes</hi> writing in Hebrew calls by the Jewiſh name <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah.</hi> Not that <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Jehovah</hi> was the ſame, but that <hi>Balaam</hi> took his <hi>Baal,</hi> a falſe God, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome deifyed Prince of that part of the World, for <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or the True God; and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Intention calls him by that name. Nor doth the Truth of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy argue him to be a divine Prophet, to whom the True God was wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal himſelf; becauſe although he might intend to make his addreſs to a falſe God, yet <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or the True God, might take advantage from this to promote his True Religion, by inſpiring a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the Heathens, and in deſpight of them, to make them hear the Prediction of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:172675:65"/>
their own deſtruction from the mouth of their own Friend. Nor is it ſo ſtrange to ſuppoſe, that a Prophecy concerning our Saviour ſhould come from a Heathen Prieſt; ſince the Sibyls have predicted the ſame, and filled the whole World full of expectation of ſome mighty Deliverer about the time of our Saviour's Birth; as <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Eclogue is an undeniable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of.</p>

                  <p>But if Natural Religion be ſo Defective, and Revelation ſo neceſſary, as you contend for, and withal, if the Jews were only bleſſed with this favour, how can we excuſe the partial Juſtice of God, to make ſo much of this odd ſort of People, and leave all the reſt of the World to ſhift for themſelves, as if they were none of his Creatures? Methinks of all the Nations of the World, the divine Prudence ſhould never have picked out this curriſh Nation, to have laviſhed out ſo many favours upon a People that from the time of their Original to their Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw were the Opprobry of the World, who as <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Juſtin</hi> tell us,<note place="margin">Tacit.

would not ſo much as direct a Man in his way, unleſs he was of the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Race.

One would have thought, if the Deity had been inclined to have made a diſtinction between any of his Creatures, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould have ſtood faireſt for ſuch a favour; for they were Nations of great Candor and Generoſity, who had minds that did generally abound with extraordinary Vertue and Honour: but the Jews of all Nations in the World were remarked for ſoure unſociable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; and whom their own Prophets can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear calling them often, <hi>a ſtubborn, untoward, perverſe, crooked,</hi> and <hi>ſtiff-necked People.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Credentius,</hi> pray let me ſee how you can excuſe the Juſtice and Wiſdom of God in being ſo liberal of his Revelations to this People only.</p>

                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:172675:66"/>1.

Thus are the Children of <hi>Seth,</hi> God's vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church in the Antediluvian Times, who were for this very reaſon called the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> Gen. 6.2. And the Children of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> are ſeparated from the prophane off-ſpring of <hi>Ham,</hi> Gen. 9.26, 27. And therefore in the time of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> when Idolatry was ſpread, well nigh over all the World, it was very wiſely contrived of God Almighty, to ſet up the Poſterity of this good Man, to be the Worſhippers of the <hi>True God,</hi> when the reſt of the World had lapſed into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Idolatry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither can this argue any injuſtice in God,<note place="margin">No injuſtice in God.</note> becauſe it does not appear that the Heathens had any right to demand of God a Particular Revelation. They had the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> as 'tis generally called, or the old Adamical Revelation to walk by, and what Rewards, or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments were annexed to that, they were either to expect, or fear.

more eaſy, ſince he might diſpenſe his Rewards upon what Conditions he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. I doubt not but that good Gentiles had their Reward allotted for them; but then I ſee no Reaſon why they ſhould be their own Caterers, and cut out what work they pleaſed for themſelves. For, if it pleaſed God to ſet the Gentiles to work out their Salvation with more pains and danger, and the Jews and Chriſtians with leſs, why ſhould the divine Juſtice be taxed with Partiality, more than you ſhould be, when you think fit to ſet ſome of your Workmen to an eaſier, and others to an harder Task, when all of them are obliged to undergo the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and painful, when you ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to aſſign it?</p>

Neither can I ſee any reaſon why the Juſtice or Wiſdom of God ſhould be called in queſtion for this liberal diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Revelations to the Jews alone, for which we can aſſign no reaſon. For there are a thouſand Inſtances in Providence to be made which are ſubject to the ſame dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties. Tell me why the unhappy Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Greenland,</hi> and <hi>Iſland,</hi> are not all born in ſuch a Garden of the World as <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly?</hi> Or why God beſtowed ſuch a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoil upon the <hi>Italians</hi> only above all the reſt of the <hi>Europeans?</hi> Tell me, <hi>Philolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:172675:67"/>
why God has bleſſed you with a more delicate Perſonage, and a happier Stock of Natural Parts than your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? Why ſuch an one is born to a great Eſtate, and others to none at all. Why ſuch an one is made a Man, and not a Monkey? Why another Thing is an Animal, and not a Tree? Now theſe are all particular favours of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, which other parts of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion want; and yet you will not ſay that this is any reflexion upon the Wiſdom or Juſtice of God. Why therefore ſhould we tax them in beſtowing this favour of particular Revelation to the Jews? For I dare ſay, I can as eaſily prove, That the Jews were as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of their Prophecy, as any Man can be to be an <hi>Italian,</hi> or an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> to be beautiful or wealthy. We Men are not able to give a reaſon for any of theſe benefits, and therefore muſt refer all to the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or <hi>good pleaſure of God.</hi> Not that this <hi>good pleaſure of God</hi> is any capricious reſolution of him, but a wiſe determination of his Will, grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on juſt reaſon, although unknown to us.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:172675:68"/>
World are ſo apt to amuſe us; and that in the great circles and revolutions of God's future Diſpenſations all the preſent Inequalities ſhall be made up, and all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts ballanced. But after all, the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi> alone is a ſufficient reaſon to ſatisfy all reaſonable Men of the Wiſdom and Juſtice of God, in placing Men and Things in a better or worſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World, and in communicating to them greater or leſſer benefits. If all were to enjoy the ſame favours of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there would be no ſubordination of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which is the great Beauty of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; there would be only one confuſed Heap of good Things without order or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which would be ſo far from being an Argument of the divine Wiſdom, that it would be a conſiderable proof againſt it. Beſides, no one would praiſe God for the Benefits they enjoy, if all enjoy'd the ſame in common with them, for the univerſality would take off the edge of Mens Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently of their Gratitude; and they would be as liſtleſs to give thanks to God in this condition, as they are to thank God for Health, or Wealth, as when they never experienced either Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Poverty. And therefore as God has wiſely contrived it in his <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> Providence, for the Beauty
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:172675:68"/>
and Order of the Univerſe, that ſome Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhould be <hi>Vegetables</hi> as well as others <hi>Animals,</hi> that ſome ſhould be <hi>Brutes</hi> and others <hi>Men;</hi> and among Men themſelves, that ſome muſt be Poor as well as others Rich; that ſome muſt labour as well as others govern: ſo likewiſe in his <hi>Spiritual</hi> Providence, or in his care of the Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wellfare of Mens Souls, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that God ſhould ordain ſeveral Claſſes or Orders of Future Happineſs, or ſhould be more or leſs bountiful to them in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording them Means in this World of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And as for the Jews whom you do not think to be ſuch fit Objects of the Divine favour in communicating to them his Revealed will,<note place="margin">Jews not ſuch ill Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</note> as the <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> that is a Point, I am afraid, you will never be able to make out. Indeed it is grown a mighty faſhion of late, even among thoſe that are better Friends to Chriſtianity than you, to caſt very ſevere Reflexions upon the Jewiſh Inſtitution, and, under pretence of ſhewing the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the Chriſtion Religion, do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions be-devil the Poor Jews. I do not think this the beſt way to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Chriſtianity, by undermining the foundation, which it is built upon; for the Law is but the Ground-work of the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:172675:69"/>
Goſpel, and if we deſtroy the firſt, the latters falls. And as for the People of the Jews, which of late are ſo much uſed to be vilified, I do not find that they are more liable to cenſure of this nature than other Nations. It cannot indeed be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but that this People were prone to Idolatry, and did very often lapſe into it; which is the occaſion of thoſe very ſevere reprehenſions you meet withal in the Prophets, and which you hinted at juſt now. But then this is in ſome meaſure to be palliated by the mighty grandeur and pageantry of the Idolatrous worſhip of all the Nations round about them, and the great ſcorn and reproach which was caſt upon the Jewiſh ſingularity in the worſhip of one God, which muſt needs have no inconſiderable influence upon vulgar minds. And as for their aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to a familiarity with the Heathens, it was but a practice agreeable to the Moſaical Law (<hi>Vid. Deut.</hi> 7.) which was a wiſe command of God, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone preſerved his True Worſhip, in that Nation only, free from the infection of Idolatrous Nations round them, for ſo many Ages together. And although perhaps in the Times of <hi>Trogus</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> the Jews might be more ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous this way, than their Law required;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:172675:69"/>
yet that muſt be imputed to Phariſaiſm, which was the prevailing Sect among the Jews at that time, and which by falſe Gloſſes and ſuperſtitious Doctrines, had perfectly debauched the Jewiſh Religion, and ſoured the greateſt part of them into an unſociable Temper. But after all the faults that may be charged upon them, the ſtedfaſt worſhip of the One True God, for ſo many Ages in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, when all the World beſides was over-run with Polytheiſm and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, when they were ſo much ſcorned and vilified by the Heathen World for his ſake, underwent ſo many Captivities, Perſecutions, and Martyrdoms; this was enough to endear them above the reſt of the World to God Almighty, to incline him to <hi>commit his Oracles</hi> to them alone, and to guide them by his <hi>revealed Word;</hi> rather than to the <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> or any other Idolatrous Nation, who, beſides their diabolical ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were ten times more lewd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd.</p>

The Bible therefore muſt by you Theiſts be allow'd to have ſo much of the Truth of Prophane or ſecular Hiſtory, as to regulate <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s Hiſtory, who ſeems plainly to have copied either at firſt or ſecond hand from it. So that if there be any Truth in <hi>Juſtin,</hi> the ſame muſt be more expreſs in the Bible, from which <hi>Juſtin</hi> had his Relation, though he has blended it with other Fables. Nor is it difficult to think how a Heathen ſhould come at a ſight of that Book, or at leaſt a Relation out of it. For <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi> who wrot the Hiſtory which <hi>Juſtin</hi> Epitomized, was a Retainer in the Family of the Great <hi>Pompey</hi> who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Judea,</hi> and therefore in the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his Maſter there, without doubt he picked up this imperfect Relation of the Jews, either by reading their Books, and afterwards, forgetting or miſtaking them; or by mixing the True Hiſtory with the Fabulous reports of ſome Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Gentiles. So that in ſhort, the Scripture-Hiſtory muſt regulate his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.

And then ſee how finely This does agree with it. He makes the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Original to be from <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and that <hi>Abraham</hi> was King of that place; where <hi>Arathes</hi> the Wife of <hi>Syrus,</hi> one of their ancient Kings, was worſhipped.

That <hi>Moſes</hi> his Son's name was <hi>Arvas</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Aaron,</hi> who was an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſt, who afterwards ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Kingdom, and from

hence came the cuſtom that the Jewiſh Kings were always Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>Now what a fooliſh and contradictious account of the Jewiſh Hiſtory is this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Juſtin?</hi> Who ever heard of the names of <hi>Azelus</hi> and <hi>Adores</hi> in the Jewiſh ſtory? When was ſuch a Goddeſs as <hi>Arathes</hi> worſhipped generally by the Jews, who were always fam'd for the worſhip of one God? where by the way this is only a ſimple miſtake of the Author, to ſay <hi>Arathe</hi> for the <hi>Aſtarte,</hi> or <hi>Aſtaroth,</hi> of the <hi>Sidonians.</hi> Here is again <hi>Abraham</hi> miſtaken for the Father, who was the Grand-Father of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Here are <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s <hi>Ten</hi> Sons ſet down for his <hi>Twelve;</hi> his little Eſtate miſtaken for an Empire, and the Twelve Tribes for Ten Kingdoms. Here is <hi>Joſeph</hi> taken for <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Youngeſt Son, who was his eldeſt by another Venter; and <hi>Moſes</hi> paſſes for <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Son, who lived Three or Four Hundred Years after him. Here is the name of <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid to be impoſed by <hi>Jacob,</hi> which was not known till the time of the Captivity, a Thouſand Years afterwards. Here are the Plagues which <hi>Moſes</hi> inflicted upon <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> altered for the ſcabbineſs of the Jews, as if thoſe heavy judgments came only by infection; and the ſpoiling of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> of their <hi>Bracelets, Ear-rings,</hi> &amp;c. tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:172675:72"/>
into the running away with their <hi>Sacra.</hi> Here is the Hiſtory of the Manna and Quails confounded with the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath; and their Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of not communicating with the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons attributed to the fooliſh Fable about their Itch, or Leproſy. And, beſides, here is again <hi>Aaron, Moſes</hi> his Brother, miſtaken into his Son, and turned from a Jewiſh into an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſt; here is the ſame <hi>Aaron</hi> made King of the Jews, who was never otherways than Prieſt; and that ſaid to be the original of the Cuſtom of the Jews having their Kings their Prieſts, when never any ſuch Cuſtom obtained amongſt them; but only the Author has blundered the Hiſtory of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> Government into this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. So that, <hi>Philologus,</hi> I would have your Gentlemen for ſhame leave of, to abuſe the Jewiſh Nation with falſe ſtories out of Heathen Hiſtorians, that knew ſo very little of their Country, and are guilty of ſo many miſtakes about it. For in this ſhort account of <hi>Juſtin</hi> you ſee there are almoſt as many miſtakes as words; whether they are willful and malicious, or no, I ſhall not determine; but I am ſure the account we find in Scripture, to all reaſonable Men muſt be ten times leſs liable to exception.</p>

                  <p>Theſe are but ſmall things, <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius,</hi> for us to make many words about; but I am afraid, you Inſpiration Men are guilty of a very great fundamental Errour, in taking that for ſome ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Revelation of God, which is only Natural Reaſon. For I cannot be brought to think, that the Prophets or other Writers of the Bible, which are ſaid to be inſpired, had the Mind of God revealed to them, any other way, than by the common natural way of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Knowledge. For Natural Knowledge is but the Revelation of God, wherein God reveals to our minds the natures of things, which were unknown to us before; ſo that God may he as well ſaid to ſpeak to us by our reaſon, as by the Scriptures; and Natural Knowledge may be allowed to be divine, as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God, as well as they. And I doubt not, but that it was the Hebrew way of uſing the word, <hi>God,</hi> that has betrayed both Jews and Chriſtians into the fancy of <hi>Inſpiration</hi> and <hi>Revelation,</hi> in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern ſenſe; when formerly nothing but pure natural Knowledge was meant by it. For the Hebrews had always a very Religious and Devout way of talking, and attributed almoſt all Natural Actions to God: if they had gotten Money by their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:172675:73"/>
induſtry, they would ſay it was given them by God: if they had a good thought, they would ſay, God put it into their Hearts, and the like. So a great many other things were ſaid to be <hi>divine,</hi> or to come from God, which were only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but wonderful, or extraordinary. Thus the <hi>mountains of God</hi> is only ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name for <hi>great mountains;</hi> they <hi>Sleep of God</hi> for a <hi>deep ſleep;</hi> and the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> Gen. 6. are but great Sons or Giants. Now it would be a mad way of Interpretation, to ſay all theſe things were inſpired, becauſe they have God's name added to them. Therefore why ſhould we ſuppoſe that thoſe Men, who are called Prophets in Scripture, had any divine and ſupernatural Revelation, only becauſe they are called <hi>the Men of God,</hi> or are ſaid to have the <hi>Spirit of God?</hi> For this is only an uſual Hyperbole to denote that they were extraordinary Men, Men of ſound Reaſoning and notable parts, and exquiſitely gifted to move and perſwade the People. And this is no more than what the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> mean by <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Godlike (i. e.)</hi> extraordinary; only becauſe the Hebrews made uſe of <hi>Genitives</hi> inſtead of <hi>Adjectives,</hi> they called him the <hi>Man of God,</hi> which the Heathens would have called a divine, or
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:172675:73"/>
extraordinary Man. So when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are ſaid to have the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> what needs I pray of coyning an Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Revelation of divine Truth, to explain this by? For the Spirit of God has ſo many ſenſes; and thoſe ſo very diverſe in Scripture, that I think it is not fair to clap that particular ſenſe only upon it, which it may but bare poſſibly ſignify. Sometimes it ſignifies only the <hi>Wind,</hi> as <hi>Iſ.</hi> 40.7. The <hi>Ruach,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of the Lord, blew upon him,</hi> that is a very dry and fatal wind. Sometime it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Soul, as <hi>Job</hi> 47.3. <hi>The Ruach, the Spirit or Breath of God is in my noſtrils.</hi> Sometimes it ſignifies Life, as <hi>Ezech.</hi> 37.14. <hi>I will give my Spirit to you, and you ſhall live:</hi> That is, I will recover you, and give you <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> again. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times it ſignifies <hi>Mercy,</hi> as <hi>Mich.</hi> 2.7. is the <hi>Ruach,</hi> the Spirit <hi>(i. e.) the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God ſtraitened?</hi> And the word <hi>Spirit</hi> it ſelf ſingly is noted to ſignify a Temper of mind, as, <hi>Caleb was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirit, (i. e.)</hi> a better temper than the murmuring Jews, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.24. And in other places of Scripture the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Jealouſy, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Meekneſs, the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which ſignify Tempers and Diſpoſitions of Mind.</p>
                  <p>From all which I conclude, that when
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:172675:74"/>
in Scripture the Prophets are ſaid to have the Spirit of God, the meaning is only, that they have <hi>great Minds,</hi> or Spirits, or extraordinary holy diſpoſitions, above the reſt of the People. Which expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſignifies no more in Hebrew, than what the <hi>Greeks</hi> mean when they ſay, the ſame of a brave Poet or Orator, that he has in his Writings <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſome thing divine and admirable, and far above the rate of common Authors. So that when by theſe Paſſages of Scripture, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, That the Prophets were good ſolid Writers and Excellent Preachers; why ſhould you go about to ſpoil their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and make them only Enthuſiaſtical Dreamers? And now, let my Infidelity be as great as you would make it, you ſee I am a better Friend to your old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, than you your ſelf.</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:172675:74"/>
great miſtake. For Natural Knowledge cann't be ſaid properly to be the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only the Gift of God. Indeed what ever we know, we ſhould never come to the Knowledge of, unleſs it had pleaſed God's goodneſs to endow us with theſe intelligent faculties; but then no body ſays, that God reveals theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Truths to us, but only he gives us the faculties of diſcerning them. Nay let us be as Platonical as we pleaſe, and aſſert that all the notions of the Soul are but ſo many Intuitions on the Deity, and our viewing ſome of thoſe Infinity of Truths, which he is pleaſed to exhibit to us, by communicating himſelf to us: I ſay although we explain natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this way, yet this is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, which we generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <hi>divine Revelation.</hi> For this firſt is a general way of God's communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating himſelf indifferently to all Men; for all Men do indifferently partake of a conſiderable meaſure of Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But this latter way of God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing himſelf, which in particular we call <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> is a favour which God has vouchſafed but to a very few of all Mankind, that they might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, what was ſo revealed to them, to the reſt. By the firſt, Men only have
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:172675:75"/>
a power of perceiving the Ideas and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of outward Objects, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding and dividing thoughts, of affirming and denying concerning them, of fitting premiſſes, and deducing Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; which every ones own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells him he has by nature. But the latter is a ſupernatural Impulſe of the Divine Power, which inſtills into Mens Minds Thoughts not attainable by human Reaſon, or elſe gives them an Authority, as coming from God, which they had not before. And therefore it is an idle Fallacy, to call thoſe natural Deductions of Reaſon and Common Ideas of Things by the name of Revelation, from which they do as widely differ, as Light and Darkneſs. This is only a ludicrous Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which your ſort of Men have got of making uſe of Religious Terms, when you believe nothing of the Thing, and expoſing Religion, by leaving nothing in it but a few empty names. And beſides, they have another end to ſerve by it, which is this, That then their Infidelity does not appear ſo barefac'd when they make uſe of the old Terms in an Infidel ſenſe; for otherways ſuch Writers as <hi>Hobbs, Spinoſa,</hi> and the Author of the five Letters, would appear ſo horrid to all Ears that had the leaſt ſpark of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:172675:75"/>
Chriſtianity left, that Men would be ſcar'd from them at the firſt reading; and ſo all hopes of making Proſelytes for the Devil would be over. But by this ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and mincing the matter, Readers are cajoled into Infidelity unawares, and the Authors eſcape the puniſhment like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which would otherwiſe attend an open and barefac'd Blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And it is much ſuch another kind of Argumentation,<note place="margin">Prophets not only extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Men.</note> when you would have the Prophets, which are ſometimes in Scripture called <hi>the Men of God,</hi> to be only Men of good Parts, and very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Men; becauſe forſooth great things in Scripture are ſometimes called by the name of God. For what though the <hi>Mountain of God</hi> be a great mountain, and Nimrod a <hi>Hunter of God</hi> be a mighty Hunter, may not therefore <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> be inſpired Prophets? I pray where lies the conſequence of this? Indeed if they were only in general ſaid to be <hi>Men of God,</hi> and had no other Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, nor no other demonſtration of their Prophetick Spirit, there would be then ſomething tolerable in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the name of <hi>Men of God</hi> is an expreſſion which is but rarely, but once or twice in Scripture, made uſe of to ſignify a Prophet, 1 <hi>Kings, Chap.</hi> 13.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:172675:76"/>
there are other names which are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed for that purpoſe. Such as <hi>Nabi</hi> which ſignifies one that has particular converſe and familiarity with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.7. and <hi>Roeh,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.22, and 16.28. and <hi>Choſeh,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.11. 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 21.9. both which words ſignify <hi>Seers,</hi> as denoting Men that are accuſtomed to <hi>divine Viſions,</hi> or ſupernatural <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beſides there are ſuch innumerable expreſſions in Scripture which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate a particular Revelation from God Almighty, and a peculiar intercourſe of theſe holy Men the Prophets with him, that no reaſonable Man can deny it, unleſs at the ſame time he denies the Authority of the holy Scripture and makes it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Impoſture. Gen. 15.1. <hi>The word of the Lord came to Abram in a Viſion ſaying, Fear not, Abram,</hi> &amp;c. Now what tolerable ſenſe can be put upon theſe words, but only that this was a particular Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God to <hi>Abraham?</hi> You cann't ſay that this is only ſome remarkable ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and is therefore in the Jewiſh Phraſe called <hi>the word of the Lord.</hi> For here is no room for any ſuch kind of Metaphor. Here is a particular Dialogue of God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> God ſaid: <hi>Fear not, Abram, I am thy ſhield and thy
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:172675:76"/>
exceeding great Reward. And Abram ſaid, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, ſeeing I go childleſs, and the Steward of my Houſe is this Eliezer of Damaſcus?</hi> Then <hi>v.</hi> 4. is related the reply of God Almighty. <hi>And behold the word of the Lord came unto him, ſaying, This ſhall not be thy Heir, but he that ſhall come forth out of thine own Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,</hi> &amp;c. Now what can be more poſitive and expreſs of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Intercourſe with God, than this Relation? So again, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.5. The Revelation made to <hi>Moſes</hi> is related as expreſly. <hi>God called unto him out of the midſt of the buſh, and ſaid, Moſes, Moſes.</hi> Then follows the anſwer of <hi>Moſes, and Moſes ſaid, here am I. And the Lord ſaid, I have ſurely ſeen the affliction of my people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Come now therefore and I will ſend thee unto Paraoh.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid <hi>unto God, Who am I, that I ſhould go to Pharaoh, and that I ſhould bring the Children of Iſrael out of Aegypt?</hi> And God ſaid, <hi>Certainly I will be with thee,</hi> &amp;c. And after this rate the Dialogue continues the full length of the Chapter. Now if this be not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of an Intercourſe with God, and a Revelation from him, there is no ſenſe to be put upon any words, though never ſo plain, there muſt be no aſſent given to the literal narrations of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:172675:77"/>
                     <hi>Livy;</hi> but the credit of both thoſe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories may as well be criticized away as this.</p>
                  <p>So again as for the other Prophets, when we are particularly told, that the <hi>word of the Lord came unto them</hi> at ſuch a time, in ſuch a manner, in ſuch a particular Year of ſuch a King's Reign, what can poſſibly be meant leſs than that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed this to them? When they are commanded to take rolls and to write, as <hi>Iſ.</hi> 8 1. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.2. and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies ſo commanded to be written, are there recorded; when every Prophecy begins with <hi>the word of the Lord,</hi> or <hi>thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> when in ſome of them are particular Interlocutions between God and the Prophet; if this be not Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Prophets who wrote theſe Writings, muſt be the greateſt Cheats and Impoſtours in the World, in ſo often pretending to it when they had not the leaſt ſhare of it. But it vexes one to ſpend time to anſwer ſo ſimple an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which is worth no ones notice, but that the great <hi>Spinoſa</hi> has taken ſo much pains in it; and other retailing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels after him would ſeem to do ſome great matter with it.</p>

Which is a thing ſo frequent and ſo plain in Scripture, as is not to be bantered away by a little fooliſh Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm; and is a Truth never to be ſhaken, unleſs the Infidels have force enough to overthrow the whole Body of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

                  <p>Well we will ſee, <hi>Credentius,</hi> what we can do as to that matter, ſome time or other. But in the mean time methinks you outſhoot your ſelves a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in your Notions of Revelation. For you generally aſſert, that Revelation is cauſed by a more immediate and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Application of the divine Spirit, to the mind of Man, and ſo does make known to it, thoſe extraordinary Truths; which indeed is only a Caſt of the Jewiſh Unphiloſophical Ignorance. For when they, poor Wretches, could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Natural Cauſes of Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were preſently for a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for calling in God to help out
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:172675:79"/>
their ſorry Philoſophy. Every thing which was a little ſurprizing to them, they muſt needs attribute to the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Act of God, they were every moment making Mountains as well as Men of God; and according to their Philoſophy, an equal degree of the divine power was requiſite as well to make a Great Hunter, as a great Prophet. But if they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood better the Natural Cauſes of Inſpiration, they would never have been guilty of ſuch manifeſt Abſurdities. For that Inſpiration which the Jews, and the Chriſtians after them, would needs have proceed immediately from God, is only the effect of a <hi>vivid Imagination.</hi> For it is not to be thought that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had any more immediate Converſe with God Almighty than other Men; but only they had warmer Heads, a quicker Imagination, and a more lively Fancy. Other Mens Imaginations and Dreams did not leave ſuch deep and laſting Impreſſions upon their Minds, but were quickly over, and they perceived that they were but Dreams and Fancies: but the Prophetick Imaginators had ſuch ſtrong Fancies in their Heads, that were as clear to them as the repreſentations made by their outward ſenſes, and they thought they were as certain of what
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:172675:79"/>
they ſo fanſied, as of what they heard or ſaw.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis plain from Scripture, that ſtrong Imagination only is the grand Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for Prophecy. And upon this account without doubt the Jews will not allow <hi>Solomon</hi> the Gift of Prophecy; for he was a Wiſe Man in whom good ſenſe and a clear Judgment was prevalent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was ill qualified for Prophecy, to which <hi>Fancy</hi> was chiefly requiſite. So thoſe famous Men in Scripture, who are renowned for their Prudence, <hi>Heman,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 2.6. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.31.</note> 
                     <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, Kalchol,</hi> were not Prophets; but on the other ſide, the Prophets were for the moſt part out of the Country People, or Men of no Erudition; or ſometimes Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as <hi>Hagar, Abraham</hi>'s Maid, had the gift of Prophecy. For theſe People having but little underſtanding, had ſtronger Paſſions, and did abound more in Imagination, than Men who had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe, and who governed their Fancies by their Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>And that you may underſtand that Imagination was the Foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, be pleaſed to conſider, that their Prophecies differ'd only by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of their Imagination, which is a plain Argument, that the one was the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:172675:80"/>
cauſe of the other. If the Prophet was of a merry chearful Temper, then Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories and Peace were revealed to him; becauſe Men of that complexion are apt to entertain their thoughts with ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſubjects. If he was a Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man, then he propheſied only Wars and judgments, and ſuch other diſmal things, which are uſual to go along with ſuch black Thoughts. And ſo the like Diverſity, if the Prophet was addicted to Anger, or Grief, or Pitty. And for the proof of this there is a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inſtance of Scripture, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.15. The three Kings of <hi>Judah, Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Edon,</hi> are in a great ſtrait for want of Water for their Armies, they go and conſult <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet, and he being very Angry at the ſight of his Enemy, the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> tells him, if it <hi>was not for the preſence of Jehoſophat King of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, he would not look toward him, nor ſee him.</hi> Now he could not propheſie any thing that was pleaſing to them, whilſt his Choler was ſo high. And therefore he very prudently deſires that a Minſtrel ſhould be brought him: <hi>And when the Minſtrel played, the hand of the Lord came upon him.</hi> That is, the Muſick put him in a good humour, and then he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to imagine as pleaſant Things as the Kings would have him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:172675:80"/>So when <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>Angry</hi> with <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> he had revealed to him the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſlaughter of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> firſt-born, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11. So God was revealed to <hi>Cain</hi> when his Reaſon was over-clouded with paſſion, when <hi>he was very wroth, and his countenance fell,</hi> Gen. 4.5. When <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> was impatient with exceſſive Anger, (for the Text ſays, the <hi>Spirit lifted</hi> him <hi>up in bitterneſs, and in the hot Anger of</hi> his <hi>Spirit,</hi> Ezek. 3.14.) then he propheſies the miſeries, and ſtubbornneſs of the Jews.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Jeremy</hi> was alway a Melancholy Man, and weary of his Life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he does nothing but propheſie dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Calamities, which ſhould befall the Jews; and upon this account King <hi>Joſias</hi> would not conſult him, but choſe rather to conſult <hi>Hulda</hi> the Propheteſs, who being a Woman had more tender Paſſions, and to whom it was more fit that the mercy of God ſhould be revealed. Nay oftentimes Revelation does proceed from the ſtrong, though falſe Opinions of Men.</p>
                  <p>Thus King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Augurs Propheſie of the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by looking into the Entrals of Beaſts, and by divining with Arrows, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.21. and thus the Nativity of Chriſt was
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:172675:81"/>
revealed to the Magicians, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. who believed the fooleries of Aſtrology, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Imagination of a Star, which they ſuppoſed to have ariſen in the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>So that in ſhort this Prophetick Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was a very good way of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending a Religion to the Jews, who were a very ignorant People, and were more wrought upon by theſe fanciful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of God made by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the deſcriptions of his feigned Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, Interlocution, Promiſing, Threatning; than by any juſt and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Diſcourſes of Vertue and Vice, which ſhould be made to them.</p>
                  <p>Not but that Natural Knowledge does include more certainty than this Imaginary Prophecy, only this latter ſerves better for the uſe of leſs inquiſitive Men. For <hi>Natural Knowledge</hi> brings Self-Evidence with it, but <hi>Revelation</hi> requires always a <hi>Sign,</hi> or reputed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, which the Prophets were forced to make uſe of as the Credentials of their Prophecy. Indeed <hi>Revelation</hi> may have ſomething in it of a moral Certainty, that the Men who pretend to it are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, well meaning Men; and that the matter, which they ſpeak, is deſigned for the bettering of Mankind, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming them from their Vices: but I

That in thoſe things which are obſcure to us, we ſhould conſult the Gods by Divination, for they make known thoſe things to them, to whom they are propitious.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I think it but a vain attempt to go prove to you, That Imagination is not the Cauſe of Inſpiration: for I do not ſuppoſe that in reality you do believe it; only by this odd ſort of diſputing, you endeavour to make our Religion ſtand upon as looſe a bottom as you can, that you may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to overthrow it at your leaſure. For I dare ſay, you do not believe a word of Revelation at all, and therefore why ſhould you trouble your ſelf about the cauſes of it? All that you and your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Spinoſa</hi> mean, when you talk of Prophecies conſiſting in <hi>lively Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> is, that the inſpired Prophets were only a parcel of Melancholy, crack-brain'd, Enthuſiaſtical Folks, that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the People of <hi>Judea</hi> a number of Phanatical Dreams and Viſions. But becauſe there is ſo much pains taken in this Argument, I will ſhew you, that the Prophets, or inſpired Men of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were not Men of this complexion, as you contend for, and that the Inſtances which you have alledged, make nothing for this Opinion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For it does not appear, that the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:172675:82"/>
Prophets were more Melancholy or Fanciful than other Men are.<note place="margin">Prophets not Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</note> And it is but a fancy of <hi>Mounſieur Petit, de Sibyllis Lib.</hi> 1. to aſſert, that Melancholy was the chief Diſpoſition to make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; and that <hi>Moſes</hi> was an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Melancholy Man, becauſe he choſe to live a ſolitary Life in the Wilderneſs, feeding his Father-in-law <hi>Jethro</hi>'s Sheep; and becauſe he is noted in Scripture to be <hi>ſlow of Speech,</hi> Exod. 4.10. For theſe do not appear to be any Arguments at all of Melancholy. For a Paſtoral Life does by no means denote a Man, to be of a Melancholick Complexion, but contrariwiſe more debonair and pleaſant; and therefore the Shepherds in polite Nations, as among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> are always deſcribed as Men of great Mirth and Jollity, and ſpending their whole Time in Pleaſure and Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. Neither did <hi>Moſes</hi> leave the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> Court, for a Melancholy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement in the Country; but was forced to fly from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to avoid the Anger of the King, after it was known, that he had ſlain the <hi>Aegyptian.</hi> Neither, whilſt he ſo abſconded, did he ſhew any ſign of Melancholy there, but only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Cuſtom of his Nation, and generally of thoſe Ages, choſe to make
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:172675:83"/>
his Employ the Keeping of Sheep. So that <hi>David,</hi> who is deſcribed in Scripture to be of a ſanguine Complexion, and famed for ſprightful Singing and Playing, may be as well taxed for Melancholy, when he kept his Father's Sheep, as <hi>Moſes</hi> might. Neither is the ſlowneſs of his Speech any Argument of his Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe very ſanguine Men are often troubled with that infirmity, which does generally ariſe from ſome defect of the Vocal Organs in the Mouth, and not from Mens Complexion and Temper of Mind. And beſides, what is commonly tranſlated <hi>ſlow of Speech</hi> is in the original, <hi>Heavy,</hi> or <hi>Difficult of Mouth,</hi> which may be any defect of ſpeaking, which does render Men leſs eaſy to be underſtood, by ſtammering or faſt ſpeaking, as well as ſlow ſpeaking. And therefore, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 3.5. People of another Nation are ſaid to be <hi>heavy of Language,</hi> becauſe they could not be eaſily underſtood by the Jews. And <hi>Moſes</hi> might as well have been very quick in his Talk, and upon that account mightily given to Heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then this would rather ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue him to be of an eager and volatile Temper, than any ways given to Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
                  <p>But as for all the reſt of the Prophets, it
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:172675:83"/>
is plain, that they were no Melancholy Enthuſiaſts, becauſe their Diſcourſes and Writings are perfectly different, from what is uſually ſaid by that ſort of Men. There is nothing comes from them, but what is grave and ſedate, and agreeable to good ſenſe and Reaſon, and a well-compoſed mind. Do we find any thing in them, that is like the mad Tranſports of <hi>James Naylor?</hi> Read but the lives of <hi>Sancta Tereſa,</hi>

                     </note> and <hi>Maria Magdalena de Pazzi,</hi> and ſee if the Prophetick Writings bear any manner of Correſpondence with their fooliſh talk. Did ever any one of the Prophets ſpend three Years before his Death, in nothing but repeating ſuch an odd Ejaculation, as <hi>thy Will be done in Time, and in Eternity,</hi> as <hi>Molinos</hi> reports of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Lopez?</hi> Beſides their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are full of juſt reaſoning and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unaffected Relations, which do by no wiſe agree to Enthuſiaſtical Men. Read but the Hiſtory of the Pentateuch, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hiſtorical parts of the Bible, and ſee if they look like the Compoſitions of wild Enthuſiaſts. If <hi>Naylor</hi> had been to write the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> he would have made an otherguiſe ſpot of work of it than <hi>Moſes</hi> has. He would have clogged every Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with odd Parentheſes, [Great is the Lord of Hoſt! Judgment! Horror!
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:172675:84"/>
Deſolation, Damnation! <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]; he would never have kept his brains cloſe to the order of a juſt Narration, but would have jumbled the Creation and the Flood, <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Do you think that any one of thoſe Popiſh Dreamers could have made uſe of ſuch ſolid Reaſoning, and ſuch Critical Remarks upon the Old Law, as are to be found in the Writings of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Author of the Book of the <hi>Hebrews?</hi> Could they have made ſuch wiſe obſervations upon humane Life, and given ſuch Rules of Piety and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Books of <hi>Solomon</hi> are full of? Could they have framed ſuch admirable Forms of Devotion, as the Book of <hi>Pſalms?</hi> All that they were able to do, would be to write ſome mad ſtuff, which no Man of ſenſe would have Patience to read three Leaves of. Had the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures no other inſpiration, than the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of fanciful Brains, there would no one part of it be coherent with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Hiſtory would be claſhing with Hiſtory, and Prophecy with Prophecy, and nothing ſuit together, with that order and ſymetry, as now we find it. Ask two craz'd Men in <hi>Bedlam</hi> to tell a ſtory out of the Bible, and then ſee how theſe Men of Imagination will correſpond to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:172675:84"/>
talk ſingly with two Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Quakers, till they be warm upon the Book of the Revelations, and ſee then how finely their Prophecies will agree. I am ſure they will fall infinitely ſhort, of being ſo uniformly of a piece, as the holy Scriptures are. Let the greateſt Infidel of you all conſider, that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful correſpondence there is between the four Evangeliſts, among themſelves, where there is no difference to be found, but what among Writers, which had not confederated together, ſhould be; and obſerve the ſame in the Books of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles.</hi> See how the ſame great Deſign is viſible throughout the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Writings, the Prophets, and the Goſpel. How exactly does the lapſe of Mankind, by <hi>Adam,</hi> agree with the Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made by Jeſus Chriſt? How does the old Levitical Law plainly appear, to be but the Sciography, or rough draught of the Goſpel, and the Characters and Lines of one exactly viſible in the other? For my part, I think it impoſſible for ſo many, though judicious and wiſe Men, without aſſiſtance from God, to carry any one deſign with that exactneſs that the Penmen of the Holy Scripture have: but I am ſure it is the greateſt of Abſurdities to aſſert, that ſuch a noble and uniform
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:172675:85"/>
Deſign ſhould be carried on, through ſo many Ages by a parcel of wild Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts.

What ſay you to the buſineſs of Miracles? Are not theſe think you pretty things to cheat the Mob with? But I am afraid they will never ſtand the Teſt of Philoſophy and Reaſon. One would wonder how ſuch Non-ſenſical Notions as theſe ſhould come into the World, but conſidering the ſtupidity of them, one might gueſs them to be of Jewiſh Original. For probably when the firſt Jews ſaw the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentiles worſhiping the <hi>Natural Gods,</hi> as Sun, Moon, Earth, Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they to ſhew theſe conſtant mutable and viſible Gods, to be under the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or Inviſible one; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to brag of the Miracles which they pretended <hi>Jevovah</hi> had done by triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:172675:90"/>
over poor Nature for their dear ſake, for whom they were fond to believe all things were made. Thus this notion got from the Jews to other Nations, and ſo they have been coining Miracles ever ſince. But really, Sir, a Miracle in your ſenſe, is Non-ſenſe. For you ſuppoſe ſomething above the power of nature, which is the greateſt and higheſt power in the World. For the power of Nature is the power of God. <hi>Nature</hi> is one, eternal, fixt, immutable Chain, which is infinitely drawing out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding it ſelf, and not capable of the leaſt alteration; now if it was poſſible (as you ſuppoſe) by a Miracle that one Link of this, ſhould be diſturbed or broken, the whole frame of nature would be confounded, and the whole Scheme of future Beings would be infinitely irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. Nature is the Eternal Will and Decree of God, executing it ſelf, and the Will of God is his very Eſſence; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is firm and immutable, nay im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be changed by the contrary Will of God himſelf: and therefore we may be ſure, it is not to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> of every Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious Prophet. And indeed Miracles are nothing elſe but the Dreams of blockheaded brains, or a ready ſolution
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:172675:91"/>
of what the uneducated Mob are wont to gape at, and can give no account of, ſo that I doubt not, but that a common Almanack-maker that could calculate an Eclipſe, or write it out of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemeris, would be a moſt wonderful Prophet among the <hi>Indians;</hi> but when theſe People, by liberal Education, come to underſtand the exact motions of the Heavenly Bodies, the Miracle would be at an end. Nay any thing that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual is by the vulgar reputed a Miracle, <hi>becauſe forſooth they admire it, though it be never ſo natural;</hi> but it ceaſes to be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, when their Admiration is wrought of. Thus a Comet is to them a moſt wonderful Miracle, becauſe it appears but now and then in a great many Years: but the Sun is no Miracle at all, becauſe they ſee it every day; not that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the nature of the Sun better than that of a Comet, but by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beholding it, it does not make ſo great impreſſion upon their fancies, and therefore they ceaſe to admire it. And I doubt not but this is the true reaſon of moſt of the reputed Miracles of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are but the unuſual works of nature, which would neceſſarily have been for all any Inſpired Perſon; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they being uncommon works of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:172675:91"/>
the vulgar wondred at them, and deemed them Miracles. O! but we muſt have a care of exploding Miracles, becauſe they do demonſtrate the being of a God; and very lamely too. For the neceſſary Laws of Nature, and the frame of the World, are a thouſand times more demonſtrative of it. For Miracles, or Interruptions in Nature, make wiſe Men rather doubt of it, and ſeem rather fortuitous Blunders, than the wiſe works, or Efflux of the Deity. Nay what proof is there by Miracles of any thing elſe, or that any Doctrine came from God? For the Jewiſh Law allows, that Miracles might be done by falſe Prophets, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1. <hi>If there ariſe among you a Prophet, and giveth thee a ſign or won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the ſign or wonder come to paſs, whereof he ſpake unto thee, ſaying, Let us go after other gods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>you ſhall not hearken unto the Prophet, for the Lord your God proveth you.</hi> Nay what were the Jews the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for all the Miracles they had among them, ſuppoſing they were true? <hi>Moſes</hi> with all his Miracles was not gone from them but a few days, but they were turned as arrant Heathens as any in the World, and fancying the Image of God into the figure of a Calf.

Now if the World be the Creature of God, as we have proved it to be, then it muſt be ſubject to his Power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. For God's Creation ſuppoſes it ſubject to his power, for what is not ſubject to the Power of God muſt have a greater Power of its own to reſiſt his Power. But this is impoſſible for the World, or nature to have, becauſe all the power which they can poſſibly have, they had from God in their Creation. Therefore God ſtill keeps the power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, either to annihilate them, to continue them in their being, or to alter them. To ſay that God has alienated this power, or given them a greater, is more abſurd. For this is in effect to ſay God has diveſted himſelf of his Deity, and made the World God inſtead of himſelf. All that can, with any probability, be ſaid, is, That God by the frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the World has been pleaſed to make it immutable, and therefore this power being paſſed out of his hands, he cannot recal it, without violation to his Wiſdom, and a perfect Confuſion to the preſent Scheme of Beings. But to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this a little. As God by his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Power created all things, ſo by his Providence he governs them, and takes care of them. And it is equally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:172675:93"/>
to ſay any thing ſhould not be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by <hi>Infinite Providence,</hi> as to aſſert any thing might be created without <hi>Omnipotent Power.</hi> Both theſe are God's Attributes, and to do Violence to either of theſe is injurious to God. Now how can it be ſaid, that God by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence takes care of the World, when he has made ſuch a fatal unalterable World that it is out of his power to take care of? For whatſoever is governable, or the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Government, muſt be in ones power and alterable: but God can no more govern a fatal World, than a Man can govern the Winds and the Sea. But to govern and take care of his Creatures is the neceſſary Attribute of a Wiſe and a Good God; and therefore the World which he takes care of muſt be governa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and conſequently not Fatal.</p>

For generally the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which are recorded in Scripture, are ſuch as the vulgar are as proper Judges of as the greateſt Philoſophers.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:172675:95"/>
performance by Mechanick Philoſophy, which had amuzed the common People into the Opinion that they were Miracles; then ſomething of this nature might be pretended. But when all the Miracles in Scripture are ſuch as the meaneſt Men might be Judges of, and which they cannot be deceived in, the caſe is quite different. Any ordinary Man might be Judge whether it were not by a Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous power, that Bitter Waters by a word of the Prophet were made ſweet; that an Iron Hatchet was made to ſwim; that a Dead Child was raiſed to life. Every ordinary Man was as good a Judge of Taſt, of the Heavineſs of Iron, and when the Soul was departed from the Body, as the greateſt Philoſopher. When our Saviour, by a word ſpoke, turned Water into Wine, Cured the Blind and the Lame, and raiſed Men from the Dead; in theſe caſes the relieved Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and every beholder, could tell that this was above the power of nature, as well as thoſe that had continually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves to the ſtudy of it. There is no need for an Inſight in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, or the Mathematicks, for Men to know when they are ſick, or when they are well; to know that though Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick does often cure diſeaſed Men, yet
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:172675:95"/>
words naturally do not; that Medicinal Operations are ſlow and gradual; and therefore when they ſee Men inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly cured of a Diſeaſe, which for a long while has baffled the power of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, that this muſt needs be by a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural power, when they ſee all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural means have failed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And your Aſſertion is equally falſe,<note place="margin">Miracles not make Men doubt of a God.</note> wherein you lay down, That Miracles do rather make Men doubt of a God, than prove his being to them. Now we do not ſay, that Miracles are the beſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove the Being of a God, for the moſt excellent frame and contrivance of the World are the moſt obvious proof of it. But Miracles are far from making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe Man doubt of the being of a God. For the wiſe, and conſtant Ends and Regularities in nature are ſo forcible a Proof upon Men of his Being; that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very little diſorder cannot make a wiſe Man doubt of it. For if I behold in any work a thouſand Wiſe Ends that I am able to diſcover; I may very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that a few other things were as wiſely deſign'd, whoſe ends I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to gueſs at. But why ſhould Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles make Men doubt of the Being of a God? In my mind they do plainly prove his Exiſtence. For when ever a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:172675:96"/>
is done, there is ſomething done by a power ſuperiour to nature: now if there be a Power ſuperiour to Nature: then Nature is not Self-exiſtent, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there is a God which created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This muſt be demonſtration to all materialiſts, that allow nothing in the World but infinite and eternal <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and a neceſſary concatenation of Cauſes. For if a Miracle or ſupernatural Power breaks or diſturbs one Link of theſe Cauſes, and Nature afterwards goes on undiſturbedly again, it is moſt certain that there is a Power above nature which directs it; for otherways a neceſſary and fatal Nature would move on with an infinite diſturbance. So that I ſay, <hi>Philologus,</hi> that though to an Epicurean who would have all things come by chance, Miracles are not ſo good a Proof of a Deity, as the Frame of the Univerſe, and the Wiſe Ends of things; yet to a Materialiſt, who will have all things to be nature, the Eviction of a Miracle muſt be demonſtration: for this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws his whole Hypotheſis, and tells him to his face, that Matter and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are but a limited and ſubordinate Power, and in ſubjection to a ſuperiour Mind or Power, which is God. Nay let the Miracle be true or falſe, either
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:172675:96"/>
wrought by God, or the Devil, it is home-proof againſt a Materialiſt; for a <hi>Witch,</hi> or an <hi>Apparition,</hi> is total Deſtruction to that Philoſophy. Therefore it is no wonder, that ſo great an outcry is raiſed againſt Miracles and preternatural Powers; for if theſe are once evinced, the Hobbiſt is at an End.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.<note place="margin">Falſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles no Argument againſt true ones.</note> And whereas you object againſt Miracles, that they are no Proof of an Inſpiration from God, becauſe there may be a great many falſe Miracles; and that <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the 13th of <hi>Deut.</hi> gives them warning of the ſame: I think this is only puzzling the Caſe, and raiſing a duſt inſtead of arguing the Point. For what though there be falſe and pretended Miracles, are there therefore no true ones? Becauſe there have been many falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, muſt therefore no true Evidence be credited? Becauſe there are very many Quacks and Empiricks, are there no good Phyſicians in the World? Becauſe there are many Knaves, are there no honeſt Men? This is a mad way of concluding, which would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all humane Society and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the World. Men muſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat nor drink, becauſe ſome Men have been poiſoned thoſe ways. They muſt receive no good money, becauſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:172675:97"/>
there is a great deal of Counterfeit. They muſt believe nothing that is told them; becauſe there are many Liars among Men. Now Man would be the moſt miſerable Creature in the World, if he were to ſquare his Actions by this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. But God has given to all Men judgment and reaſon to diſtinguiſh between Truth and Falſhood, between ſincerity and deſign. And this we muſt make uſe of in conſidering miraculous powers, and proving the Spirits whether they be of God. By this we may diſcern whether the produced Miracle be above the Power of Art or Nature, or whether it does not ſhew the finger of God; whether it be the effect of a deluded Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and not rather the Evidence of clear and undiſturbed Senſe; whether it be the operation of God, or the power of the Devil; whether it tends to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Kingdom of Light, or of Darkneſs; whether it tends to further Moral Goodneſs and Piety, or elſe Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and ſuperſtition; whether it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to the ſtrengthening or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of God's Laws; whether it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms what we are ſure God has revealed before, or contradicts it. Now with this caution we may very well diſtinguiſh true from falſe Miracles, and aſſent to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:172675:97"/>
the True, whilſt we reject the Falſe. And therefore <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Chapter which you alledged, does with very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, give the Jews warning that they do not receive Impreſſion from Miracles with too great precipitancy, and gives them a good Rule to judge when they are falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> namely, when they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the ſtanding Rules of Morality or any other Revelation of God. <hi>If there ariſe among you a Prophet, or a Dreamer of Dreams, and giveth thee a ſign, or a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> &amp;c. ſaying, <hi>Let us go after other Gods</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ye ſhall not hearken unto the words of that Prophet,</hi> &amp;c. but <hi>ye ſhall walk after the Lord your God, and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and obey his voice,</hi> &amp;c. This is but wiſe and diſcreet caution; but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all true Miracles for the ſake of ſome Impoſtures, is unreaſonable Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, and would tend to diſpute all Truth and Certainty out of the World, and make all men turn Pyrrhonicks and Seekers.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And it is likewiſe falſe,<note place="margin">Inſtances of the Jews, and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</note> which you in the next place lay down; That the Miracles, and Inſpiration among the Jews, had no influence upon their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, or Lives, from the Inſtances of the Idolatrous Jews in the Wilderneſs, and King <hi>Solomon.</hi> Indeed I can by no
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:172675:98"/>
means excuſe the Jews for their Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Defection to Idolatrous Worſhip, whilſt <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the Mount; but yet I cannot go with you ſo far, as to aſſert, that the figure of a Calf was thought, by them, to be the Divine Image. For this is ſuch a Groſneſs as is not to be ſuppoſed in Humane Nature; it is moſt probable that they deſigned this only as an Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick, or Emblem of the True God, in imitation of the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> For as the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> with whom they had long converſed, worſhipped their God <hi>Apis,</hi> under the Hieroglyphick of a <hi>Bull,</hi> or <hi>Calf:</hi> ſo the Jews who loved a pompous ceremonious worſhip, thought to worſhip the True God ſo too.

                  <p>But after all, <hi>Credentius,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perſwaded, but that it was the prejudiced Opinions of the Unphiloſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Jews, and their pretence more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the Divine Protection, which gave occaſion to the riſe of ſo many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in Scripture which might otherways be naturally accounted for. It would be too long to run through all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Miracles in Scripture, which I could eaſily make out to be done by the power of Nature; I ſhall only pick out one or two which may ſerve as a ſampler for the Reſt, and may prove, that they all may receive a Philoſophical Solution. Now, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.15. God is related to ſend <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> but in this miſſion there was nothing, but what the Order of Nature did require; for <hi>Saul</hi> at that time was ſeeking his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Aſſes. So God is ſaid to ſend the Locuſts as a Plague upon <hi>Aegypt,</hi> of which there was a plain natural Cauſe, for an Eaſt-Wind blew them out of another Country, and a Weſt-Wind carried them back again. So God is ſaid to ſet the Rainbow in the Clouds, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced there by the natural Cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction. And again, there is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:172675:99"/>
Miracle related in <hi>Joſhua</hi> of the Sun's ſtanding ſtill, and making a long and miraculous day, when it happened only by the reflection of the Sun-Beams on the Neighbouring Hills, or the refraction which was cauſed by the Air, which at that time was full of Hail and Snow, as is evident from the great ſhower of Hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, which ſo annoyed the Enemy. Now, theſe, and ſuch like Miracles, were deviſed, only to raiſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People's Devotions, and to affect their Fancies, which would not receive an Impreſſion by an ordinary way of Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but when it was ſaid, That God immediately intereſſed himſelf in ſuch an Action, it made them preſently to prick up their Ears, and be very attentive and devout.</p>

Neither do your Inſtances, which you have alledged, in any wiſe prove what you contend for.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:172675:99"/>
For as for your Inſtance of God's ſending <hi>Saul:</hi> although <hi>Saul</hi> by the bent of his own Inclination was ſeeking his Father's Aſſes; yet God by making uſe of this natural Act of his Will and proper Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, brought it to paſs, that he ſhould meet the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> who came to anoint him King. For unleſs you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that God Almighty has the power of inclining, over-ruling, and turning to his own proper ends the Wills and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Men, you muſt exclude God from having any thing to do in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World; otherways Mankind would be the arbitrary Lords of the whole Creation, and as a long as they had a free-Will, (unleſs oppoſed by an open and apparent Reſiſtance) they muſt act in Defiance to their Soveraign Lord and Maker. And therefore God in his infinite Wiſdom is pleaſed, to let his Almighty Power mix and blend it ſelf with the natural actions and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, that he may gently lead them to the Ends he has propoſed, whilſt they are ſeemingly going thither themſelves. Which is a great kindneſs and condeſcention to Humane Nature, that he will not ruffle and ſtruggle with them, and force them againſt their Wills to do what he would have them, but
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:172675:100"/>
only caſts ſuch a gentle influence upon their minds that they ſhall do that of their own accord, which he might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe have forced them to. 'Tis need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to give a philoſophical account of the divine <hi>Inclination</hi> of the Will, whether it be by exciting new Ideas in the mind, or reviving old ones, by Reminiſcence, or Memory, by raiſing and ſetting a keener Edge upon the Paſſions, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new objects to the ſenſes, or engaging them in a nicer Obſervation: for let the <hi>Modus</hi> of this be how it will, as long as God is the Governour of the World, and does exerciſe a providence over his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſome way or other, he muſt have an Influence over Mens Wills, though at the ſame time they ſeem to make uſe of them with the greateſt Freedom. And this way God Almighty is ſaid to have ſent <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> by gently influencing his Will, and the exterior Objects which inclined it, ſo as to make him ſeem to do that of his own proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which God would have him do. It is not eaſy to aſcertain, where Divine Influence gave the firſt Impreſſion in this caſe. It may be probable upon the fancies of the Cattle, who had ſome unuſual Idea raiſed in their Imagination, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined them to wander, and then it was
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:172675:100"/>
natural enough for <hi>Saul</hi> their Maſter's Son to purſue them, where he met <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.</hi> So that you ſee in this caſe that every thing worked with its own proper tendency, but yet all was managed and over-ruled by the Wiſdom and Power of God. But as to your Inſtance in the Rainbow. Now though this does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from natural Cauſes, yet it is very properly in Scripture attributed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to God. For though it is probable, that the Rainbow was antecedent to the Deluge, (there being the Sun and Seas, and conſequently Clouds and Rainbows) yet God is very properly ſaid to <hi>ſet his Bow in the Clouds:</hi> becauſe he ſat it there for a <hi>Token,</hi> or a <hi>Sign:</hi> although it was a <hi>Rainbow,</hi> yet it was not a <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Token</hi> before it was a <hi>Rainbow</hi> by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Courſe of Nature, but it became a <hi>Token</hi> by God's ſpecial Ordinance. And ſo for the matter of the Locuſts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.14. What though they came with an Eaſt-Wind, and went away with a Weſt? Will the pure blowing of an Eaſt-Wind produce Caterpillars? Or ſuppoſing them to be blown from another Country, ſuch innumerable quantities of them, as were never heard of before, ſo great as utterly to deſtroy all the Herbage of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> were equally, as miraculous, as if
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:172675:101"/>
there had been an inſtantaneous Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them. And what reaſon is there to aſſert this Plague of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, when all the others are ſo apparently miraculous? You muſt either deny the Hiſtory, or grant the Miracle; for there is no bantering of all thoſe wonderful and tremendous Plagues with ſuch little Criticiſms. And the ſame I have to ſay to your Explication of the Sun's ſtanding ſtill in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time. Now let any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man conſider, if there be any thing in that Relation which looks like <hi>Spinoſa</hi>'s account of the matter, <hi>viz.</hi> the Twilight, being at that time more than ordinary protracted by the refraction of the Sun-beams, through the Snowy Air. I grant ſomething like this may happen, for a minute or two; but what is this to the Suns ſtanding ſtill a whole day? <hi>So the Sun ſtood in the midſt of Heaven, and haſted not to go down about a whole day.</hi> Joſh. 10.13. Nay though we ſhould grant you, what ſometimes comes to paſs from the thick ſleety Air in <hi>Greenland,</hi> that the Sun was ſeen when it was a degree or two below the Horizon; yet this will not ſalve the matter. For the Text ſays expreſly, that the Sun ſtood ſtill the whole day <hi>in the midſt of Heaven,</hi> or the Twelve a Clock Line; that is, it was
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:172675:101"/>
twelve a Clock for twelve hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Sun ſtaying ſo long in that one Point. But if your account by Refracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were true, the day muſt receive its Lengthening about Sun-ſetting, when the Sun was near the Horizon, and that not above a quarter of an hour at the moſt. Neither could this eaſily come to paſs, in ſo thin an Atmoſphere as that of <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> Beſides, the Scripture ſays expreſly, that this was prayed for by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> in order to encourage the Jews, and to diſhearten their Enemies. But why ſhould he pray for ſuch a natural Effect as you would have this to be? Was it worth any ones while to wiſh for a minute or two more day light, which it was impoſſible, that either the Jews, or their Enemies, could obſerve? But I am weary of anſwering ſuch Arguments as theſe, which fall of themſelves, and which I am confident can never convince thoſe that urge them; and 'tis honeſter to deny the Authority of Scripture alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, than to explain the Force of it away, by ſuch jejune interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                  <p>Why then, <hi>Credentius,</hi> if you would have me appear a Barefaced Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, I muſt plainly tell you, that I do not think, that either <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Prophets,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:172675:102"/>
who ſucceeded him, had any degree of that Inſpiration which they pretended to. For what ever is inſpired muſt needs be true, and agreeable, both to Reaſon and Goodneſs; but there are many things to be found in their Writings and Lives, which are contrary to both. I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with <hi>Moſes.</hi> Indeed, <hi>Credentius,</hi> you have, in ſome meaſure, vindicated him from ſome Abſurdities, which are uſually imputed to his Hiſtory of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note n="*" place="margin">Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with a Theiſt. <hi>Part I.</hi>
                     </note>, but I'm afraid your Art will fail you in doing as much, for ſome other Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt his Books and Character. Now I pray; Sir, what do you think of his Hiſtory of the Deluge? Don't you think this very odd, that the whole World ſhould be drown'd at the ſame time? For my part I can as ſoon believe, that a Man could be drown'd in his own Spittle, as that the World ſhould be deluged by the Water in it. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays expreſly, that <hi>all the high Hills under the whole Heaven were covered.</hi> Now to do this, we muſt have water enough to reach up to the Top of the Pique of <hi>Tenariff,</hi> which is at preſent three Miles perpendicular, and at the Time of <hi>Noah</hi> much more, a conſiderable part of it being waſhed down by the rains ſince. Now where ſhall we find water to cover the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:172675:102"/>
Earth above three Miles high quite round? If the whole Ocean were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumfuſed, it would do little or nothing towards this effect, much leſs a Rain of forty days. For the Water of the Sea, take one place with another, is hardly a quarter of a Mile deep; for though in ſome places in a deep Channel it may be half a Mile, towards the ſhore it is but three or four fathoms, ſo that all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is not more than a quarter of a Mile deep. But if this were all pumped out of the Channel of the Sea, and kept againſt its Nature by a Miracle ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the higher Earth; it could co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole Earth no deeper in Water than the Sea is now, which is but a quarter of a Mile; So that there will want two Miles and three quarters of the height which <hi>Moſes</hi> aſſigns to it. This is upon ſuppoſition that the Sea and the Dry Ground are nigh of the ſame Extent; but I believe an exact ſurvey of the Earth about the Northern and Southern Poles, would ſhew that the Earth was much larger. But granting them of the ſame bigneſs; to raiſe the Channel of the Sea, three Miles higher (that is, to the Tops of the higheſt Mountains) round the World, would take up twenty-four times as much Water as there is
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:172675:103"/>
now in the Sea, twelve Quarters of a Mile deep in Water (<hi>i. e.</hi> twelve Oceans) to be laid upon the Sea, and twelve more upon the Land. And then pray conſider, what becomes of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Inſpiration of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Hiſtory, when 'tis Demonſtration that there is not the twentieth part of Water in the World, as is ſufficient to cauſe ſuch a Deluge.</p>

The Deſign whereof was ſo Great and Noble, the Language ſo exact, the Thought ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate; the whole work ſo uniform and of a piece with it ſelf, and adorned with ſuch variety of pleaſant learning; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were ſuch ingenious Accounts given of the Great Revolutions of Nature, of the <hi>Formation</hi> of the World, the <hi>Paradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiacal ſtate,</hi> of the <hi>Antediluvian Longevity,</hi> the <hi>Deluge</hi> and <hi>Conflagration;</hi> that tho' there might want ſome degrees of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability to make every Reader believe his <hi>Theory,</hi> exactly True, yet it pleaſed moſt of them ſo, as to think it was pitty it was not. Far be it from me to detract from the ingenious gueſſes of that Learned Man; but yet there are ſome things in that Hypotheſis, which ly very difficult in my mind, and do not ſeem ſo agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Mechanical Laws he goes by,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:172675:104"/>
and other <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in Nature. The <hi>Oval Figure,</hi> which he aſcribes to the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Earth, ſeems inconſiſtent with the preſent Figure which it is found to be of, that is a <hi>Prolate Sphaeroide,</hi> or an <hi>Oval</hi> turned about its leſſer <hi>Axis (i. e.)</hi> of the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Loaf.</hi> Which was a prudent deſign of Nature to make it of this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, becauſe the additional Heaps of Ice and Snow, which are continually lodged at the Poles, by the vapours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly flying North, and South, ſhould never increaſe the Globe beyond a Circle. His excluding the <hi>Annual Motion</hi> of the Earth, and its Motion of <hi>Paralleliſm</hi> to the Poles of the World, allowing it only a ſimple Motion round an <hi>Axis Parallel</hi> to the Poles of the Ecliptick, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taking away the viciſſitude of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which is one of the greateſt Beauties of the World; and leaving the greater part of it uninhabitable, is a matter which one cannot ſo eaſily comply with; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the firſt Chap. of <hi>Geneſis</hi> ſays, that the Stars ſhall be <hi>for times, and for ſeaſons, and for Days, and for years.</hi> And ſo is his excluſion from thence of the <hi>Seas, Hills,</hi> and <hi>Great Rivers,</hi> allowing only ſome trilling ſtreams from the Poles. For the World without the Sea, would be
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:172675:104"/>
but a Priſon, where Men would be lock'd up from one another without intercourſe, would have no communication in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, Arts, Invention; but People muſt be content to live uncomfortably at home, upon their own Stocks, and their own Improvements. Without <hi>Hills,</hi> Men would be bereaved, of the Ornament and Convenience of Metals, of the uſefulneſs of Minerals and Stones; and Men would have wanted Money, Domeſtick Utenſils, Phyſick, and Buildings. Nay without <hi>Hills</hi> to drain off the Miſt and Rains, and <hi>Seas</hi> to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate the Miſt and Rains from, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable to me, how there ſhould be ſuch a thing as a River in the World; and I fancy the eaſy deſcent upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity of an <hi>Oval</hi> as big as the Earth, is not agreeable to the Laws of <hi>Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and the uſual current of Waters. Nor is it leſs difficult to me to imagine, how a Cruſt of ſo vaſt a Thickneſs, as that of the Earth muſt be, ſhould be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by any natural force, eſpecially being ſupported equally by the ſubterraneous Waters; or as for any fiſſures or cracks by the Heat of the Sun, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in the hotteſt Countries, not to go many Yards into the Ground; and as for any Earth-quakes raiſed by evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:172675:105"/>
of the <hi>Abyſs</hi> below, every Ditcher can tell, that the Heat of the Sun-beams does not go ſo many inches under Ground, as this Hypotheſis muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Leagues; and beſides Earth-quakes, and ſubterraneous Eruptions, are not cauſed by rarefied Vapours, but by the accenſion of ſulphureous Damps, which like Gun-powder, rend, tear, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all before them, and are often wont to break out in viſible Flame. Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thoſe vaſt Fiſſures and ugly Gaps would have been more inconvenient and unſightful in the <hi>Antediluvian</hi> Earth, than the moſt barren Mountains and rougheſt Seas are with us. Neither does the uſual depth of the Channels of the Sea, ſeem to anſwer to the Depth of the <hi>Abyſs;</hi> nor the regularity of the Mountains to the accidental Fragments of ſuch a Cruſt. There would then appear frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prodigious Wells and Gaps, where the fragments did not exactly meet, and ſuch horrid and naked <hi>Apices,</hi> which could not by this time, have been any thing ſmoothed by Rains, or covered with Graſs or Herbs. Nay even in the very ſituation of the Mountains, and greateſt Hills, there appears wiſe contrivance, and not accidental Fracture; for to go no further than our own Country, all our
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:172675:105"/>
great Ridges of Hills, in <hi>England,</hi> run Eaſt and Weſt, ſo do the <hi>Alps,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in ſome meaſure, the <hi>Pyrenees;</hi> ſo do the Mountains of the Moon, in <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> and ſo does Mount <hi>Tauras,</hi> and <hi>Caucaſus.</hi> And further there appears a prudent foreſight, in not making the ridges of Hills, continued, but by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them off into <hi>Tumuli,</hi> or <hi>Heads,</hi> parts of each of which lies obliquely behind another, and generally admits a skew paſſage between. For unleſs there was ſuch a Ridge of Hills frequent from Eaſt to Weſt, the Vapours would all run Northward, and there would be no rains in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Countries, but the Rivers dried up, and the Sea it ſelf in time evaporated and frozen into Polar Ice. And unleſs the Hills were divided into theſe oblique Breaks, ſo as to keep back the Vapours and let in the Northern Air, the World would be far more liable to Peſtilences and Putrefaction than now they are, and all Places as unhealthy as <hi>Scanderoon.</hi> Theſe things, with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the <hi>Americans</hi> from another race than <hi>Noah,</hi> and ſome other matters of leſs conſequence, are my reaſons why I cannot ſubſcribe to that learned Doctor's Solution of the <hi>Noachical</hi> Deluge; and therefore muſt beg his leave to caſt about
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:172675:106"/>
and ſee if I can find a better elſewhere, that I can more eaſily acquieſce in.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> to whom the World is forever indebted, for his curious and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Obſervations of Shells and Minerals, and other ſubterraneous Phaenomenas, has promiſed in his <hi>Eſſay,</hi> a more <hi>natural Hypotheſis;</hi> but one of the Grounds which he deſigns to build his Theory upon, does ſeem to me ſo precarious and impoſſible, that I muſt ſee a great deal of good proof, before I can aſſent to it. For it does not appear to me, how it is poſſible that the waters continuance a few months upon the face of the Earth ſhould diſſolve the Compages of the moſt rigid Foſſils, and ſuſpend the particles of them all in the circumfuſed water, except only conchous ſubſtances; and that, when the waters were withdrawn, they ſhould be let down to fix and be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted again. For if it was poſſible that water in ſo ſhort a ſpace could diſſolve Marbles and Adamants, yet methinks the ſame ſhould more eaſily diſſolve Oiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhells and Cockles, which are of a more tenuous compoſition, and more eaſy of Diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Whiſton,</hi> in his <hi>Theory,</hi> has avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt of the Difficulties which were chargeable upon the Firſt, and has given
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:172675:106"/>
the World a Taſt of the extraordinary Mathematical, and Philological Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſtands poſſeſt of. The chief fault I find in him is, that he has ſtuck more to Mr. <hi>Newton</hi>'s than <hi>Moſes</hi> his Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and ſeems too too fond and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his Ingenious Hypotheſis of the Comet. Nay the imputing this great Cataſtrophe to the neceſſary Laws of a Comets <hi>Trajection,</hi> which the Scriptures tell us was ſent by God for the Sin of Mankind, ſeems to give too great a ſcope for the ſcoffs of Libertines, and the Atheiſtical Fatality. His Turning <hi>Days</hi> into <hi>Years,</hi> and denying the Diurnal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of the Earth at firſt, is methinks a little too bold, when it does not ſeem at all to favour his Hypotheſis, but only to give God ſix Years time to work in, when the Infidels already grudge him ſo much at ſix days. His fancying two Courſes of Rain from the Scripture, which only ſeems to repeat the Relation of one, is not to me ſo ſatisfactory; nor his Excluſion of Clouds and Miſts, which is agreeable indeed to the <hi>Burnettian Theory,</hi> but, I think, not to his. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I conceive, that the bare paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the Tail or Atmoſphere of a Comet could afford the thouſand part of the Water that Theory has occaſion for,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:172675:107"/>
and he himſelf is forced to fetch a great part of it from the Abyſs. Nor is it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that the Earth, a cold Planet, ſhould go off with 750,000. Miles of the Comets Tail, which could not be ſupported by the Comet it ſelf, but only by reaſon of the burning heat of the Body of it. And it is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, I ſuppoſe, to think, that the round Circle about the Body of the Comet is a watry Atmoſphere much groſſer than the Tail, ſo as to afford nine times as much Water to the Earth paſſing through that, as through the Tail; for the <hi>Ring</hi> is by ſome curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſervers thought to be only the curling and winding round of the ſmoke, riſing at firſt to a determinate height from all parts of the Comet, and then making off to the part oppoſite to the Sun, as you may ſee Fig. III. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I fancy that the Earth, paſſing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven through the Atmoſphere of a Comet, could gain any more Water by that, than any thing can do by paſſing through the ſmoke of a Chimney; for both of them are but ſmoke, only the former is the thinner, as being the Fume ariſing from the Terreous part of the Comet, by its <hi>Parelion</hi> almoſt vitrified and calcined, the aqueous parts being firſt
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:172675:107"/>
evaporated and ſent off farther in the extremity of the Tail. And beſides, I cannot conceive, how the Earth ſhould not almoſt have been fired, and <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Ark, burnt to powder, by the glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat of the melted Planet; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my little Philoſophy, I ſhould imagine it as comfortable living in a red hot Oven for an hour or two, as in ſuch a ſultry Atmoſphere as this. And it is hard to think, that this Comet ſhould give no more diſturbance in this part of the Univerſe, but only to turn the Earths <hi>Annual Orbit,</hi> from a Circle to an Ellipſis; for according to Mr. <hi>Newton</hi>'s Principles, if the Comet had been bigger than the Earth, it had carried it away to rights in its <hi>Parabola,</hi> through the vaſt <hi>extra-Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine</hi> ſpaces, and if it had been leſs, it had been ſtopt by the Earth, and ſo we had been troubled with its ſmoaky Tail about us ever ſince. Or if it had been of the ſame bigneſs with the Earth, and if it had well nigh the ſame celerity with the Earth, we ſhould have had the ſame troubleſom Companion nevertheleſs; or however, it is ten thouſand to one, but it would have run away with our <hi>Moon,</hi> if it had happened to have come nigher to That than the Earth does. Nor does it ly eaſy upon my mind, how ſuch a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:172675:108"/>
quantity of Water, that he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to have come from the Comet, could be diſpoſed of; it is impoſſible it could be one quarter of it ſuſpended in the Air, or lodged in the Channels of the Seas; for the Channels could bear no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to it. Nor can I think the Seas were ſo much as inlarged by the Deluge, but that they both, before and ſince, have been growing leſs, and leſs, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious quantities of Water employ'd in the production of Trees and Plants, which are reduced afterward into <hi>Mold,</hi> and always retain the ſpecies of Earth, or ly buried in the Ground, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Sea again. To ſay nothing of how much more is employed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of Stones and conchous ſubſtances, how much is licked up by the <hi>Aether</hi> out of the Atmoſphere as the Earth is ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through it, how much more flies over in vapours to the Poles, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Barricado of the Hills is frozen there and never returns again, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome few Particles, it may be, of them at ſome ſeaſons of the Year in Winds: and to paſs over the obſervations of the Channels of great Rivers near the Sea, which ſeem formerly to have been far broader than they are now, and the many great Countries which the Sea has
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:172675:108"/>
deſerted. And beſides laſtly, in my mind it is impoſſible that the ſwelling of the Abyſs ſhould alter the figure of the Earths Cruſt, from a Circle or Oval to a Sphaeroide; that the Water had force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do it; or that this effect could happen without ſhattering the whole Compages being of a brittle ſaxeous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, into pieces. Theſe are my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why I cannot acquieſce in the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of that ingenious and learned Gentleman, as exactly True; Yet I think it a curious Eſſay to ſhew the Infidels not only the poſſibility of the Moſaick Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, but how finely it may be made to correſpond with Philoſophy; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, that 'tis eaſier to find faults with this Theory, than to compoſe another ſo good.</p>

Whether it was formerly bigger or no, and grown nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower by Age, I cannot tell; but this I can tell, that That which I ſaw was but little. Now they make this the ſign of the Hiſtory. Twice in a year Water is brought into the Temple: and not only the Prieſts bring it, but all</hi> Syria <hi>and</hi> Arabia. <hi>Nay Men come even from</hi> Euphrates <hi>to the Sea, all carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water; which they firſt pour into the Temple. Then the Water deſcends into the Gap; and though the Gap be ſmall, yet it receives a prodigious quantity of Water. And when they do this they tell, that</hi> Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calion
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:172675:110"/>
                     <hi>firſt inſtituted this Cuſtom, to be a Memorial of the Calamity, and his Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from it. This is the ancient Tradition which thoſe about the Temple tell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From which Relation it is remarkable, that it was the Opinion of the People of <hi>Syria,</hi> that there had been an univerſal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, that a certain Man and his Family were ſaved in an Ark, and a Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male of every kind of Animals, to reſtore again the drowned Creation; and that all this vaſt quantity of water ſunk into an <hi>Hiatus</hi> of the Earth, and made the World habitable again. Now I hope, that <hi>Moſes</hi> his Relation is not ſo incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when it has the joynt Teſtimony of ſo many Nations, and particularly the Heathen <hi>Syrians</hi> ſo exactly correſponding with it. Indeed this ſtory in <hi>Lucian</hi> is told after his way drollingly, as if he did not believe it; but yet there is no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made but that it was the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe People, though he has a mind to expoſe it.</p>
                  <p>But I need not trouble my ſelf to prove the Being of a Deluge by Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nations, when late obſervations have given Demonſtration of it. The Beds of Shells which are often found on the Tops of the higheſt Mountains, and petrified Bones and Teeth of Fiſhes,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:172675:111"/>
which are dug up hundreds of Miles from the Sea, Trees and Shrubs buried many fathoms under ground, are the cleareſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the World, that the Waters have ſome time or other overflow'd the higheſt parts of the Earth; which was the Deluge which we contend for. The truth of theſe matters is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted now, by any that have but the leaſt Inſight in Experimental Philoſophy. Nor can it be with any degree of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ſaid, that all theſe ſubterraneous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are but only the Mimical and mock Productions of Nature, for that theſe are real Shells, the niceſt Examination both of the Eye and the Microſcope do atteſt; and that they are true Bones, may be experimented by burning them; and then they will firſt turn into a Cole, and afterwards into a Calx, as other Bones do. How far Nature may ſport her ſelf in the ſubterraneous World, in the impreſſion of the Images of Terreſtrial Plants upon Slate and Coles, I will not diſpute; but that it ſhould produce True Bones and Shells, which anſwer in all reſpects to thoſe of the Genuine Animals, is incredible, and next to the boldneſs of an Epicurean Concourſe, for the Frame of the World.</p>

                  <p>I confeſs I do no think, that the Waters of the Sea are one quarter enough for ſuch a Deluge, and therefore it muſt be ſought for elſewhere. That there is a vaſt quantity of Waters under ground,<note place="margin">Vid. Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Theor. <hi>p. 1.</hi>
                     </note> and an Abyſs within the outward Cruſt of the Earth, is I think evident to any who conſiders, that in many places the Sea diſgorges it ſelf into the bowels of the Earth, and does not paſs off by any Out-Current. The ſingle <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea is a ſufficient Inſtance of this: for conſidering how many, and ſome vaſt Rivers run into it, and it having no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible outlet, what ſhould become of the Waters?

For otherways, many Ages ago the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean</hi> had over-flow'd and drowned ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:172675:112"/>

                     </note> is the moſt evident proof which can be of the Truth of this Aſſertion. And the ſame holds likewiſe in the <hi>Caſpian</hi>-Sea. And I think there is little doubt to be made, but thoſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Gulfs and Eddies which the Sailors ſhun in many parts of the Ocean, are but only great Holes or ſubterraneous Paſſages, through which the upper Sea is gulping down into the Abyſs beneath. Now if there be ſuch a great Receptacle of Waters beneath the Earth, as there is no queſtion to be made of it, ſo many mighty Seas continually running into it, then the Earth muſt be hollow, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſuperiour Cruſt concluding within it an Abyſs of Waters, as is repreſented, Fig. I. and Fig. II. If there be the ſame Quantity of Water remaining as there was at the Creation, then the total Hollow of the Earth will be filled up with Water: but if any part of it be loſt, or conſolidated upon the outward ſuperficies of the Earths Cruſt; then by the Laws of Attraction, if the Water does not exceed in Gravity the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambient Earth, it will lye round it in the Ring P S R Q and there will be a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:172675:112"/>
Hollow in the Central Part <hi>u w x z.</hi> But if the Body of Water be of greater Gravity than the Cruſt of the Earth, then the Maſs of it will lie next to the thickeſt part of the Earth, or where there is more Matter; ſo that if the Earth be thicker about the Pole X, or if there be any Internal ſolid there, it will then lie round part of the <hi>Limbus</hi> of the Earth U T X Y and leave the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low at U Y. Fig. II. Now ſuppoſe the Diameter of the Earth or Terraqueous Globe to be, as it is thereabouts, 8000 Miles, and the thickneſs of the Cruſt of the Earth a 32d part of this, as the ſecond Figure repreſents, then the Cruſt will be 250 Miles thick, which will be a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity ſtrong enough to contain the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Waters, to reſiſt the chapping from the Sun, to keep a conſiſtency in all the rapid motions of the Earth. Or let it be an Eighth part, as is repreſented, Fig. I. and then the Earths Cruſt will be 500 Miles thick, which to be ſure is abundantly ſufficient. Now upon either of theſe two Suppoſitions, there will be Water enough, when drawn out upon the ſuperficies of the Earth, to drown the World to a far greater height, than what <hi>Moſes</hi> relates. Now it is but ſuppoſing, that God by a Miraculous power ſucked

                  <p>Let the ſuppoſition of a Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Power in the Deluge be as Unphilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical as you pleaſe, I am ſure it is more Unchriſtian, and more Unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to ſuppoſe, that it came to paſs by natural Cauſes. For if it came to paſs by natural Cauſes, there muſt have been a Deluge, whether the Antediluvian World had been ſo wicked or no; and then, the Preaching of <hi>Noah</hi> to them had been all colluſion, and God's Menaces before-hand had been inconſiſtent, both with his Juſtice and Verity. If they had repented upon <hi>Noah</hi>'s Inſtructions, they could not have eſcaped the Deluge, which by this ſuppoſition depended upon neceſſary Cauſes, and could not but have been. Or to ſay that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary both for the Antediluvians to be ſo perverſly wicked, and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge muſt likewiſe happen; is to aſſert a Fatality of ſinning, is at the ſame time to deſtroy all Religion, Free-Will, and the Goodneſs of God. 'Tis therefore plain, that the Deluge did not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on natural and neceſſary Cauſes; but upon the juſt and providential Power of God, which over-ruled the Power of Nature, and might either bring the Deluge upon the World, or withhold it, according to his good Pleaſure and Wiſdom, or
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:172675:114"/>
as the Deſerts of Mankind did require.</p>
                  <p>Neither is your Notion of ſpecifick Gravity any Objection againſt our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of an Abyſs being included with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Cruſt of the Earth, even without the Fancy of a Central Solid, or Denſe Fluid, which ſome imagine. For the notion of a Central Solid is but a Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to keep in the Central Fire that ſome men fancy there, which otherways would be quenched by the circumambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Waters. But this Central Fire is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Carteſius</hi> his Conceit, who by this means has contrived to turn burning Earths into Suns, and incruſtated Suns into Earth; which is a Fancy the World now begins to be weary of. And as for a denſe Fluid, that I take to be a more precarious Hypotheſis, and leſs to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon than the other. Neither can it be ſuppoſed, that Nature muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to work in the Creation according to the Laws of ſpecifick Gravity. For according to this Rule the Sun, which is the Centre of the <hi>Magnus Orbis,</hi> muſt be the denſeſt of all the Planetary Syſtem, which though it be the biggeſt, yet is the moſt thin and Refined.<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Newton</hi>'s Princip. Philoſ. Math.</note> 
                     <hi>Venus, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> and the <hi>Moon,</hi> though nigher to the Centre of the Syſtem, are Denſer than the <hi>Earth.</hi> Neither is this rule ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:172675:114"/>
in the Earth it ſelf. For ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>heavieſt Foſſils,</hi> as Metals, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Stone, lie often very high to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſurface of the Earth, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>lighter Strata</hi> below them. Nor is there any reaſon to think that God in the Creation wrought by ſuch Laws of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. For without doubt he wrought either by his immediate Omnipotent Power, or elſe by a ſubordinate Plaſtick Nature, as he does in the Production of Animals and Vegetables ſince. And here the Laws of ſpecifick Gravity have little or nothing to do; nay we ſee they are conſtantly ſuperſeded. When the Fibres of a Tree thruſt themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from the Centre, and the Juices of it, contrary to their own proper Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, are drawn up ſo many foot from the Ground, what become here of the Laws of ſpecifick Gravity? Is the body of any Animal compoſed after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? If this were ſo, there would be no ſuch thing as Organical Parts, which are compoſed ſo admirably for the Uſe and Beauty of the Animal. If this were ſo, a Man, which is the moſt Beautiful, would be the moſt clumſy Creature in the Creation. His Bones muſt all lie towards his Feet, his Fleſh next to them, his Blood and Spirits where his Head. And
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:172675:115"/>
then conſider what a Monſter of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this ſpecifick Gravity would make him. Neither does it avail any thing to ſay, that the Compoſition of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal does in ſome meaſure anſwer to the Laws of ſpecifick Gravity, becauſe the heavy Bones which lie inmoſt are inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Fleſh and Blood which are lighter. But then pray conſider, that the Bones were not placed there by this Law, but by the prudent direction of nature to ſupport the pliable Fleſh, and to extend it to that juſt proportion which ſhe deſigned. But granting the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition True; yet the Marrow, which is much lighter than the Bones, is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within them; the Bones being its ſuperficial Cruſt, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as we ſuppoſe the Earth to be to the Abyſs. Now why ſhould not we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that God uſed as much Wiſdom and Contrivance in the Formation of the Body of the Earth, as in that of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal? Or why ſhould ſpecifick Gravity tye him up more in one than the other? No doubt there was the ſame moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contrivance in the formation of the courſe Body of the Earth as in other finer and ſmaller contextures. Only the Earth is a Body whoſe parts are ſo great as they cannot be diſtinctly view'd at the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:172675:115"/>
ſame Time, and many of them hid from us, and therefore we are apt to conclude that they are leſs elegant; ſo we proceed to Philoſophize upon it under this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and allow it only the rude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture which might ariſe from the bare ſubſidency of Parts and the Laws of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Gravity. But this is a grievous errour, and we might, with as much Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy pretend to give an account of the Organization of Animals by the ſame Laws. For I doubt not, but if we were let into the ſubterraneous World, and could have a diſtinct view of Stones and Minerals, the excellent Diſpoſition and variegation of the ſeveral <hi>ſtrata,</hi> the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Contrivances of ſubterraneous Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, by which one Sea is fed by another, and all receive their Origin from the one great Fountain of the Abyſs, and to which they all pay their Tribute again; to conſider the ſpreading Veins of the leſſer Springs, which at firſt are diſtilled from the Rains and Miſts, by uniting together do form the greateſt Rivers; if we conſider all this, we cannot but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that God formed the Earth with as much Wiſdom and Contrivance as other parts of the Creation, and that he might make it to be a Thick-ſhell ſurrounding the Abyſs, though contrary to the Laws
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:172675:116"/>
of ſpecifick Gravity, if that did contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the good of the Whole and the Uſefulneſs of Mankind, as I think the Communication of the upper and lower Seas ſufficiently does.</p>

                  <p>But ſtill, <hi>Credentius,</hi> this unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Miracle lies hard upon me, eſpecially when your Divines allow, That God generally works by Second Cauſes, even when he acts Miraculouſly and above the power of Nature; by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Nature as it were a power ſuperior to it ſelf. And indeed in the preſent caſe, it looks very odd, that God ſhould engage his Omnipotence to make the Water of the Abyſs aſcend contrary to its Nature, or that his Inferiour Agents the Angels ſhould be employ'd inviſibly to pump up ſo much Water from thence as would drown the World. Without doubt it would lie more eaſy upon Mens Minds, if this great Cataſtrophe were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for in a more natural way; in which the Laws of the Univerſe are not ſo forcibly oppoſed as in this ſuppoſition.</p>

                  <p>For my part, it lies as eaſy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my mind to think, in general, that God miraculouſly raiſed up the Water of the Abyſs, and ſent ſuch continual Spouts and Rains, that in forty days time the whole World was drowned;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:172675:116"/>
as if I was able to find out thoſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Cauſes he made uſe of in this dreadful Judgment. For after all I muſt own it to be the Finger of God, either making uſe of intermediate Cauſes, or himſelf immediately producing the Effect. If I am ſure the Effect was miraculous, what need I care where the divine power was firſt impreſſed, whether immediately upon the effect it ſelf, or upon any of its pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting and neceſſary Cauſes? I am ſure by the divine Relation, that God is in it either firſt or laſt, and this is ſufficient for my Conviction; and I think, the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not ſo much obliged to gratify our Curioſity. I doubt not but there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ways which God could have made uſe of to drown the World, even by intermediate and natural Cauſes, which the wiſeſt Philoſopher never dreamt of; and if any of theſe ways are ſhewn to be poſſible, then all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which would infer the Impoſſibility of the Deluge are at an End. Now to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with your curioſity for once, I will endeavour to ſhew what ſecond Cauſes God might poſſibly make uſe of in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luging the World, and by what means the Abyſs was drawn up over the Face of the Earth. Not that I am ſo vain to think that he did make uſe of theſe
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:172675:117"/>
means; but that if he did, the effect would be ſo far from being <hi>impoſſible,</hi> that it would, upon that condition, be <hi>neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it is moſt generally among the beſt Philoſophers agreed, that the Moon is the Cauſe of the Tides, and that the nigher ſhe is to the Sea, as at her time of Southing, ſhe raiſes the Water the higher by her Attraction of it towards her. So that if by the ſupernatural power of God the Moon were brought very near to the Earth, or the Earth to the Moon, ſuch a vaſt Tide would be raiſed, upon ſuppoſition there is communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Abyſs and the Upper Seas, that the World would be drowned to the height which <hi>Moſes</hi> aſſigns. Now I fancy this might come to paſs by the pure <hi>Acceleration of the Earth's Annual Motion.</hi> For let C D A B repreſent the Annual motion of the Earth in the time of the Antediluvians,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fig.</hi> IV.</note> which is a perfect Circle, in which it is probable all the Planets, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Creation at firſt, revolved. Let <hi>B</hi> repreſent the Earth, and <hi>I</hi> the Moon, revolving round the Earth in the Circle <hi>I p i l.</hi> Now when the Earth was in the Point <hi>I,</hi> let us ſuppoſe its Annual motion to be accelerated, ſo as to exceed the Exact Proportion there was formerly between the Attraction of the Sun H,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:172675:117"/>
and the Celerity of the Earth; and then the Earth, inſtead of coming to the point B in the Circle C D A B, will go off to the Point <hi>c</hi> and move in the Ellipſis E F D A. Now by this new Elliptical motion the Earth in the point <hi>c</hi> will be nigher to the Moon I, by the diſtance B c, than it was in the point B; which would raiſe ſuch a Prodigious Tide as would produce the Effect we contend for. And then the Moon for a conſiderable time would revolve about the Earth at <hi>c</hi> in the Circle I m h, inſtead of its ancient Orbit <hi>I p i l,</hi> which will ſo long keep up the Tides over the whole face of the Earth, as is deſcribed Fig. I. and II. But the Tides will decreaſe gradually as the Moon by her Menſtrual Courſe ſhall have made more <hi>Perihelions,</hi> for every time ſhe comes nigher to the Sun, the Sun will more and more conduce toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the reſiſtance of her own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Motion, to draw her from her late contracted to her ancient and more enlarged Orbit. So that a month or two after, when the Earth, in its Annual Courſe, ſhall be in the Point F, and the Moon be in her <hi>Perihelion</hi> Q ſhe ſhall then have enlarged her Orbit to <hi>o Q <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> greater than her contracted one <hi>w y z,</hi> or <hi>m h I,</hi> ſo that after five months, the time of the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:172675:118"/>
Continuance of the Deluge, when the Earth ſhall have come to the point D, then the Orbit of the Moon ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged to <hi>u s t,</hi> equal to her former one <hi>I p i l,</hi> or as great as her other ſhe had before the Acceleration of the Earths Motion. So that then the Moon being as far diſtant from the Earth as formerly ſhe was, thoſe great Tides will be over, and the Deluge at an End; all the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being again ſunk into the Belly of the Earth, through the ſame Cavities by which they aſcended.</p>

                  <p>Indeed, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays, that at the beginning of the Deluge it rained forty Days and Nights; but he does not ſay that theſe Rains added any thing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the Deluge of the whole World. They only raiſed the Waters to ſuch a height that the Ark was born up, and ſwam upon the Waters. <hi>And the Flood, or Rain, was forty Days upon the Earth: and the Waters increaſed and bore up the Ark, and it was lift up above the Earth,</hi> Gen 7.17. But in the two following Verſes is

expreſſed the Effect of the Waters riſing out of the Abyſs. <hi>And the Waters prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and increaſed greatly upon the Earth, and the Waters prevailed exceedingly upon the Earth, and all the high Hills, that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole Heaven were covered.</hi> So that what was the Effect of the Rains to lift up the Ark, <hi>Moſes</hi> calls only <hi>increaſing of the Waters;</hi> but when he afterwards ſpeaks of the eruption of the Abyſs, he ſays a great deal more, that <hi>Waters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed greatly,</hi> and <hi>prevailed exceedingly.</hi> And indeed this previous Flood from the Rains, or Preludium of the Deluge, was wiſely deſigned by God Almighty, that the Ark might be lift up, before the Torrent from the Abyſs came; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuch a mighty Current running with ſo great a Force, would have overthrown and drowned it before it could have been lifted up. But a Rain of forty Days having before made a <hi>Land-Flood,</hi> great enough to bear up the Earth, the fury of the roaring Torrent of the Abyſs would be broken by the yielding Waters under the Ark; and ſo would by degrees be raiſed to the height which the Waters roſe to without Danger. I will not contend that there was no more than this forty Days Rain; for it is probable that it Rained the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:172675:119"/>
part of the Time that the Waters co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the ſurface of the Earth; for the Sea then being above as large again as it formerly was, muſt ſupply a far greater quantity of vapours than could poſſibly be ſuſpended in the Air, and therefore muſt fall down in frequent, or continual ſpouts, or Rains. This I take, <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logus,</hi> to be a poſſible account of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, and is a ſufficient confutation of them who decry it as an impoſſibility.</p>

                  <p>Well! ſuppoſing that the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities of <hi>Moſes</hi> his relation of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge are not ſo great as are generally ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, yet I cannot allow him to be a true Prophet; becauſe the pretended Miracles by which he endeavoured to eſtabliſh his Laws and Doctrines, ſeem to me to be mere Artifice contrived only to beguile the ſilly Jews, and to lead them tamely by the Noſe without oppoſition. They poor Creatures! thought that God wrought mighty Miracles by his hand, whilſt he was only working De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns for himſelf, to purchaſe himſelf Admiration among the Rabble, or elſe to gain a Juriſdiction under the ſpecious name of a Theocracy. But alas! theſe Miracles are all Craft and Colluſion, which any Cunning Man might ſeem to do, If he had but ſuch ſimple Inſpecters.

Witneſs his pretending to receive the Law in Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> where he gave out that he converſed with God, who appeared there in <hi>ſmoke,</hi> and <hi>thundering</hi> and <hi>lightening.</hi> No doubt the poor folks were ſtrangely amazed at this terrible Scene. But <hi>Moſes</hi> or any other intelligent Man, knew well enough, that there was no great matter in it. For all this wonderful Appearance was in all probability only a <hi>Volcano</hi> in that Mountain, which <hi>Moſes</hi> did very politically forecaſt, that the Jews ſhould not come to the knowledge of. For if they had run gazing up the Mountain as well as he, the ſecret would have been found out, and the Miracle ſpoil'd. But <hi>Moſes</hi> very prudently commands,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ex.</hi> 19.13.</note> that a <hi>hand ſhall not touch the Mountain, but he ſhall be ſtoned or ſhot through, whether it be beaſt or man: nay, not ſo much as the Prieſts themſelves muſt come up, leſt the Lord break forth upon them,</hi> ver. 24. but only <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> who were let into the Myſtery, muſt come there. Nor is this <hi>Volcano</hi> in Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> only a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, but is confirmed by the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Travellers, who ſtill behold the Mountain full of Aſhes, which do plainly ſhew the Ruins, as it were, of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed <hi>Aetna.</hi> This, <hi>Credentius,</hi> is an Objection not to be bantered off; for
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:172675:120"/>
if this ſtands, your whole revealed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhakes; becauſe this is the very Foundation of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Inſtitution; and if there be any Trick here, as is much to be feared, all that is built upon it, is good for nothing.</p>

                  <p>There is ſo much falſe ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and groundleſs Aſſertion in this laſt Objection, that it is intolerable; and one had need of the Patience of that Holy Religion you are oppoſing, to be unmoved at it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But 'pray, Sir, what By-Ends had <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſerve by his playing this ſham Prank, as you do ſuppoſe, in the Mount? He could not get a greater Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them than He had before; he had been their Deliverer from the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and was their conducter in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and had as abſolute command over that People as could be deſired. Neither could Fame or a Deſire of raiſing his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, put him upon any ſuch indirect Methods. For he ſeems to have been the moſt ſincere and modeſt, and moſt diſintereſted Man of all Men that ever lived. He is ſo open and faithful in his Hiſtory, as to record his own Failures, and thoſe of his deareſt Relations, his Brother, and Siſter. He gave the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which was the moſt conſiderable
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:172675:120"/>
honour in that Nation, away to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Family, contenting himſelf that his own Poſterity ſhould only be ranked among the Ordinary Levites. And at his Death diſpoſed of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> a Stranger. Neither is it credible, that he would make uſe of ſuch a mean trick as this, which was ſo eaſy to be diſcovered by every bold Man, whoſe curioſity might prompt him to venture the Menaces, eſpecially when he had eſtabliſhed ſufficiently in them an Opinion of his miraculous power, by all the wonders which he had done in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and at the red Sea.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor is there any tolerable ground for this ſuppoſition of a <hi>Vulcano</hi>'s being formerly in Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> I know your Brother Infidels make a mighty Noiſe with this ſtory, but I believe they have very little Authority for it. I have ſeen ſeveral Draughts and Deſcriptions of this Mountain in Books of Travels, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found any thing which made for this ſtory. The likeſt matter, which ever I could find, and which might perhaps give contenance to this Aſſertion, is a Relation I find in the Travels of <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus Furerus</hi> a German Knight.<note place="margin">Itinerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phori Fureri <hi>Printed at</hi> Norimberg, <hi>1621.</hi>
                     </note> And he in the Deſcription of St. <hi>Catharines Hill,</hi> which is nigh <hi>Sinai,</hi> has theſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:172675:121"/>
words. <hi>In valle propinquâ Collis eſt miri aſpectus, quaſi totus exuſtus eſſet &amp; cineribus tectus, quo loco Moſen ovium ſoceri ſui paſcendarum curam habuiſſe memorant.</hi> In the Neighbouring Valley there is a Hill which is wonderful to look upon, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as if it was all burnt and covered with Aſhes; in which place they ſay is the place where <hi>Moſes</hi> kept his Father-in-Laws Sheep. Now unleſs it can be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that this Hill was Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> it will ſignify nothing. But the ſame <hi>Furerus</hi> gives a particular Deſcription of <hi>Sinai</hi> in the following Chapter, and therefore, that can be none of the Hill which he before deſcribed. This is in all probability ſome little Hill nigh St. <hi>Catharines</hi> and Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> whoſe Earth is of a blackiſh colour and barren, not unlike many of our Heaths. And this is all the ground I can find they have for the <hi>Volcano</hi> of <hi>Sinai.</hi> But ſuppoſing that little Barren Hill, were Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> they very little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Nature of a <hi>Volcano,</hi> to think there ſhould remain no other Marks of it, than only a black ground like Aſhes. Read but the Deſcriptions of Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> in <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> and you will ſtrait be of another mind. For all ſuch Burning Mountains have an Open Mouth on Top of them through which
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:172675:121"/>
they belch out their Flames, which the Ancients called the <hi>Crater;</hi> becauſe the diſgorged Cinders and melted Metals of Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> being hardened about the Brims of the Hiatus, did reſemble the Lips of a Pitcher. Now 'tis impoſſible there ſhould be a Burning Mountain without ſuch a <hi>Crater,</hi> or <hi>Hiatus;</hi> which would needs appear after the Fire was gone out, in the figure of a Monſtrous Gap unto the End of the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay this Appearance of God, or of an Angel repreſenting him, in Flames of Fire, with Earth-quake, Thunder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is very agreeable to all the Ancient Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. For my part I am of Opinion with many of the Ancients, that it was a ſuperior Angel that perſonated God, and not the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, as ſome. And this is more agreeable to Scripture, as when it is ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>That the Law was given by Angels in the hand of a Mediator</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Moſes.</hi> And ſo <hi>Joſephus</hi> remarks of his Nation;<note n="*" place="margin">Antiq.

But to ſay nothing of the pleaſantneſs of this Miracle: Methinks this was but a caſt of the Legiſlator's Cunning; to coin a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle out of the Seas Low-water. For it is a Tradition among the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> being a little more ſubtile than the ignorant Jews, or the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> which purſued him, underſtood the exact time of the Tide of that Sea, and ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried over upon the Ebb, his People ſafe, whilſt the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were loſt for lack of better obſervation.<note n="*" place="margin">Ant.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:172675:124"/>
Or however this Miracle is much leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if we aſſert with a great many of the Divines, that the Jews did not croſs the Sea; but only went in a little way, and came out again on the ſame ſide; and then ignorant folks that lived far off from the Sea, might be impoſed upon at the ſame rate, every time 'tis low water with us.</p>

                  <p>This is pretty plauſible, Sir; but pray how will you be able to excuſe his Laws from the Abſurdities which they abound with? Now theſe ſtab the Jewiſh Religion to the Heart; for how can thoſe Laws have God Almighty for their Author, which do not ſo much as ſeem to be compoſed by wiſe Men? I cannot ſtay to run through his whole Syſtem of Laws; but for my part I look upon a great number of them to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ridiculous, others contrary to common Juſtice, and the reſt but mean and pitiful, and unworthy of God the Author. What more ſilly than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of not eating the blood of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal? as if it was worth the cognizance of a Legiſlatour to forbid Men the uſe of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:172675:129"/>
Black-Puddings. Is it worthy a Divine Law to forbid the ſowing of Maſlin, or that poor Folks ſhould wear Linſey-Wolſey? And does it not look a little like a jeſt gravely to eſtabliſh, that an Ox and an Aſs ſhall not be yoked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Beſides, there are other things in the Body of his Laws, which contradict the common notions of ordinary Juſtice. What is the ſetting up in his Common-wealth ſo many <hi>Aſylums,</hi> but only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Rendezvous, or an <hi>Alſatia,</hi> for a number of Hedg-Rogues to plague their honeſt Neighbours; His <hi>Lex Talionis</hi> is unmerciful Cruelty, that when I by chance, or in a ſcuffle, have beat out a Mans Eye, I muſt ſtand ſtill to let him bore out mine in cold blood. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Eſtates, after the year of Jubilee, is to diſcourage good Parts and Induſtry, and to entail Eſtates for ever, it may be, upon the Block-headed Heirs of thoſe particular Families which firſt laid hands upon them. His other Laws about <hi>Murder, Theft, Sacrifices,</hi> &amp;c. are ſuch as are equaled by the meaneſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, and the ordinarieſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions; only here are ſome things more ridiculous than are to be found elſewhere, with a deal of Injunctions about Red-Cows, Scape-Goats, and forty things
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:172675:129"/>
more of the ſame Nature. But if God had been the Author of theſe Laws, and this Inſtitution, they had without all doubt been grounded upon admirable reaſon, excellently fitted to the benefit of Mankind, and the uſefulneſs of them to Society, and to make Men good would have been apparent to all that conſidered them; but theſe ſeem only to be an odd jumble of Arbitrary Precepts; for which there is no other but a Womans Reaſon to be given, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> forſooth, God would command them.

Indeed the Jewiſh Laws were not drawn up into ſuch an exact a Syſtemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Method, nor adorned with ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Terms, nor do ſo preciſely ſet out the minute Boundaries of Right and Wrong, as the <hi>Roman;</hi> but yet they are better calculated for ordinary Juſtice and Neighbourly Society;<note place="margin">The extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them.</note> and what is better yet, for <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> I ſay <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and I defy any Civil Conſtitution in the World to ſhew ſo many good-natur'd Laws, and enacted with ſuch a tender regard to their Fellow Creatures, as the Jews can. What more kind Conſtitution could there be than to ordain Cities of Refuge for the innocent Man-ſlayer to fly to, to avoid the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Anger of the Relations of the killed, which according to the Cuſtom of thoſe times, were wont immediately to revenge their Kindreds Death; thereby to give him Time to clear himſelf: which if he could not, the Law allows him to be dragged even from the Horns of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.14. The kind uſage
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:172675:130"/>
which by thoſe Laws is to be given to Slaves; and the ſtripes which are not to be exceeded in puniſhing Criminals, are another Argument of the Mercifulneſs of theſe Laws above others. The great care which is taken to prevent miſchief which might happen by the flat roof'd Buildings of thoſe times by ordering Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements to be made round them; and the penalty of Womens taking abortive potions, do confirm the ſame. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the Jews to ſuffer a Beggar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and not allowing new Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Men to be forced from their Wives the firſt year to the Wars, are a Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which moſt other Nations are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in. Indeed the ſame Laws puniſh <hi>Adultery</hi> with Death, but then they are ſo mild as to puniſh <hi>Theft</hi> with only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Reſtitution. In which ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you may ſee an admirable Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Juſtice and Clemency; and which may ſerve for an Example to other Governments, where Adulteries which are irreparable are pretended to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed by pecuniary Mulcts, and Thefts, for which reſtitution may be made, are Capital. Nay in theſe Laws there is a tender Regard had to Beaſt themſelves, of which the forbidding to muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:172675:131"/>
Corn, is a ſufficient inſtance; mercifully providing that the poor Beaſt which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides ſuſtenance for us, ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied its natural cravings after its own.

Thus much I have thought fit in ſome few particulars to point out the Merciful Diſpoſition of theſe Laws, which is not ſo viſible in any civil Conſtitution in the World as in this.</p>

But their ſevere <hi>puniſhment of Idolatry</hi> of all ſorts, and the great encouragement of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the one true God, from whom the whole World had relapſed, is ſuch a Glory of the Judaical Laws above all other, as can never be eclipſed by all that can be ſaid againſt them by Infidel Tongues.

The

But if they are ſo ancient as is pretended, how came they never to be heard of, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> about four or five hundred years ago? One would have thought, that ſome of the Writers of the Old, or New Teſtament, ſhould have ſpoke of ſome of them, or ſome of the Learned Fathers, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Orientals, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> who were ſo inquiſitive this way; methinks, they ſhould have ſomewhere mentioned them.

The Book of <hi>Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Orbs and Aſcendants</hi> looks like a forgery
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:172675:135"/>
about <hi>Rambam</hi>'s time, when the Follies of Judicial Aſtrology among the <hi>Arabians</hi> were at the height. But <hi>Iſaack the Zabian</hi> was infatuated to give himſelf that name, pretending to be older than <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet take his Son's Name. Or however his Jewiſh Name muſt needs tell all the World, he was no <hi>Zabian.</hi> And beſides <hi>Iſaack,</hi> in his great Book, treats of the Temples dedicated by the <hi>Zabii</hi> to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Forms;</hi> whence any body would know, the Book to be wrote by ſome one, who had been bred in a School of the Peripatetick Philoſophy. And the Diſputes in thoſe Books about the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of the World ſhew, they were compiled by ſome one, who had been where <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Arguments upon that ſubject had been bandied about. I ſhould weary you, to tell you all the ſimple Tales which <hi>Maimonides</hi> quotes of theſe Books; which are all compoſed in the very ſtrain of the <hi>Talmud;</hi> from whence any body may gueſs their Original. They make <hi>Abraham</hi> very doughtily diſputing with a great King of the <hi>Zabians,</hi> That there is another God beſides the <hi>Sun,</hi> and that the <hi>Sun</hi> is but the Hatchet in the hand of God.

there ſtill; ſo that the King at laſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leſt <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould do miſchief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his People by his ſubtile Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſeizes all his Goods, and baniſhes him to the further part of the Eaſt. Now does this look like a <hi>Zabian,</hi> or rather not like a Jew, who had a mind to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize the great Parts of his Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? Beſides, the fooliſhneſs of that Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is betrayed, by making ſuch great Monarchies in thoſe Ages of the World, when Kingdoms were generally confined to Cities, or ſmall Provinces, as appears by <hi>Abraham</hi>'s fighting half a ſcore of ſuch Kings with 318 Men. The ſame Books tell you ſtrange Tales, of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> &amp;c. which plainly ſhew them to be wrote by one, who was acquainted with the Moſaick Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy. That <hi>Adam</hi> was the Apoſtle of the Moon, and exhorted Men to her Worſhip; that <hi>Seth</hi> was a Renegado to his Father's Worſhip, and ſo was <hi>Noah,</hi> who condemned Image-worſhip. That <hi>Adam</hi> went into a far Country nigh <hi>India,</hi> and brought home a Tree with Flowers, Leaves, and Branches of Gold; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Tree of Stone, with the Leaves of another green Tree, whoſe Leaves would not burn in the Fire; that was ſo large that ten thouſand Men of the bigneſs of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:172675:136"/>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> might ſhelter themſelves under it, and that the two Leaves which he brought with him were ſo large, that each of them would cloath two Men. But I will tire you no longer with theſe inſipid <hi>Talmudical</hi> Lies, which methinks any body might gueſs, a Jew to be the Author of. But however, what rare ſtuff is this to explain Scripture by? One would wonder how it ſhould come into the heads of Learned Men to think, that God in framing his Sacred Laws ſhould have any regard to ſuch idle Tales. For my part I pity them when I ſee them ſo ſweating themſelves in ſuch a ſilly Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and throwing away ſo much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Learning to no manner of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and beſides the great Advantage they give to the Infidels, to expoſe the Laws of God, when they ſee that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſettle them upon ſo ſlender a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>

                  <p>I am heartily ſorry that the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Author <hi>De Legibus Hebraeorum</hi> has put a keen Sword into the Infidels hands,<note place="margin">Jewiſh Rites not derived from the <hi>Aegyptian.</hi>
                     </note> the better to attack Religion with, which their blunt Arguments would have been leſs able to do. Not that I think, if Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi>'s ſuppoſition ſhould be true, that the Judaical Rites were derived from the <hi>Aegyptian;</hi> that the Infidels would abſolutely get the better of us. For 'tis poſſible that God Almighty might make ſuch condeſcentions to the hardneſs of the Jews hearts and their ſlaviſh hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Pomp of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Worſhips, as to allow them in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of their Ceremonies. But I think there is no neceſſity of granting this; for all the Rites commanded by the Jewiſh Law ſeem either perfectly ſet up in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to their ſuperſtitions, or are ſuch as were practiſed in common with them, and the ancient Patriarchs, or elſe were ſuch ordinary performances in Religious Worſhip, as no Nation could eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void. I confeſs, I am far from the other opinion of thoſe who aſſert, That the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and others of the Heathen World, learned all theſe Religious Acts
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:172675:138"/>
from the Jews, becauſe ſome of them they might learn from their common Fore-Fathers, and others they might jump upon by chance, or be led to them by the natural Tendency of the thing. There are a Thouſand things which Men do very alike, and yet neither of them can be ſaid to learn or copy from one another; nor can be ſo much as ſaid to dream of what the other did. Indeed, Men of Wit and Learning may make a pother about them, ſhew their own parts in maintaining a Paradox, and amuſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary People; but they can make nothing ſolidly out in ſuch a manner. To make uſe of an odd Inſtance. I will undertake to take an ordinary Scrivener's Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that is drawn up after the moſt blundering Rate, and put it into a Learned hand that will vouchſafe to lay out time this way; and he ſhall fetch your Parallel caſes for every period or word out of the Antiquities of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> bring like quotations to every line out of the Codes and Pandects, alledge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſayings out of <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Libanius</hi> and <hi>Themiſtius;</hi> ſo that the Scrivener might almoſt ſeem to have ſtollen the Conveyance out of theſe Books: whereas perhaps the poor Man never heard a word of them in all his Life. And
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:172675:138"/>
truly I think Dr. <hi>Spencer's</hi> Book is but a Project of the ſame Nature. He finds that ſome things in the Jewiſh and the Heathen Ceremonies agree, and therefore reſolves the firſt was derived from the latter. Now 'tis an eaſy thing for a learned Man, that has leiſure enough, to pick up out of ſuch a number of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Books, which are extant, a great many expreſſions in their Explication of Heathen Rites, which may make them look ſomething like the Jewiſh Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and yet in reality they might be no more alike than the Scrivener's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance to <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Oration <hi>pro Milone.</hi> But to ſpeak to the particulars which you have mentioned:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Circumciſion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion not from the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                     </note> though it were not a Rite purely Judaical, yet it was firſt given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo deſcended down to all his Poſterity; and as to what other uſe of it there was in other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it was learned from him and his Off-ſpring. As for the uſe of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion among all the <hi>Iſmaelitiſh</hi> Race in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and among the <hi>Edomites</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Deſcendants from <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Sons by <hi>Ketura</hi> they being of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as well as the Jews, it is no wonder that they maintained their Paternal Rite as well as the other. As
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:172675:139"/>
for the <hi>Colchi, Grotius</hi> has proved them to be probably of the Ten Tribes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by <hi>Salmanaſſer,</hi> for the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſt upon <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> declares, that they own themſelves to be of Jewiſh Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if the Teſtimony of <hi>Alexander Polyhiſtor,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joſ. Lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>16.</hi>
                     </note> quoted by <hi>Joſephus</hi> be to be credited, that the name of <hi>Africa</hi> came from <hi>Afer</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Ketu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> who planted a Colony there; then we have an eaſy account how Circumciſion came to the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> alſo. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main then only the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and why they might not learn it from <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Joſeph,</hi> eſpecially when he was in his grandeur in <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Court, I confeſs I could never ſee any good Reaſon. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is ſomething difficult to think, that a whole Nation ſhould learn ſuch a troubleſome Rite of a Stranger. But the whole People of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were not circumciſed only the <hi>Hierophantae,</hi> and the Prieſts.<note n="*" place="margin">Epiph. Har. <hi>30.</hi>
                     </note> And they might take this up in emulation to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that they might not ſeem to be out-done by him in any extraordinary mark of Holineſs; as the Magicians vied with <hi>Moſes</hi> in pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do the ſame Miracles with him. And I take it to be plain, that no other Nation made uſe of an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Circumciſion of all their Males, but
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:172675:139"/>
the Jews only. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them a ſort of a Female Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion mentioned by <hi>Strabo,</hi> a cuſtom never dreamt of among the Jews. And 'tis evident that the Gentiles generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that Circumciſion was the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick only of a Jew, or elſe thoſe reproachful names given to the Jews up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, ſuch as <hi>verpus, recutitus, curtus,</hi> &amp;c. mentioned by <hi>Juvenal, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> and others, have no ſenſe in them; they being deſigned to ſtigmatize the Jews by them, for a particular ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this matter above other Nations; which if ſo many Nations, as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, had uſed, there would be no ground for. But we never find, that theſe odd names were given to the <hi>Aegyptians, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> the <hi>Colchi,</hi> or the <hi>Aethiopians;</hi> and therefore 'tis plain, that they were not univerſally circumciſed, as the Jews were.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And ſo for the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:172675:140"/>
many particulars, as learned Men have proved at large. There are two Authors which make mention of this analogous Rite of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Diod. Hiſt. Fab. Lib. Ael. Var. Hiſt. Lib. <hi>14.</hi> c. <hi>24.</hi>

                     <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> and <hi>Aelian. Diodorus</hi> ſays that the <hi>Chief Juſtice of Aegypt had an Image of Precious Stones hanging from his Neck by a golden Chain, which they called Alethea, or Truth. And that the Cauſes then began, when the Chief Juſtice had fitted to himſelf this Image of Truth.</hi> And <hi>Elian</hi> relates the ſame not much unlike. <hi>Of old among the</hi> Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians <hi>the Prieſts were Judges. And the Chief Judge was the ancienteſt among them, who gave judgment to all. Now he of all Men ought to be the moſt Juſt and Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. He had an Image about his Neck of Saphire Stone, which was called the Image of Truth.</hi> And <hi>Diodorus</hi> adds further, that <hi>after the Litigants had twice given their Libels to the Judges, then the</hi> 30 <hi>Judges confer among themſelves, and the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice does</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>apply the Image of Truth to the other ſide.</hi> Now in all this there is nothing ſo like the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> as does neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily evince that this Jewiſh cuſtom was derived from the <hi>Aegyptian.</hi> For in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> this was the Ornament of the Chief Juſtice, among the Jews the Enſigns of the High-Prieſt. Among the Jews, it
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:172675:140"/>
was a ſtanding Oracle to conſult in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary affairs of ſtate, among the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> uſed in ordinary Juſtice. Nor does it appear to me, that this <hi>Aegyptian Alethea</hi> was any more, than an Honorary Enſign of the chief Judge, who could not regularly perform his Office without it, and had nothing more Oracular in it than a Serjeant's Coif, or an Alderman's Chain. And <hi>Petrus Vallenſis</hi> in a Letter wrote from <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> ſeems to have ſeen a Mummy of one of theſe old Judges, which does aſcertain the Figure of the <hi>Aegyptian Alethea.</hi> Where he ſays he <hi>had ſeen a Mummy, about whoſe Neck a Golden Collar was painted, hanging from his Neck like the Knights of the Golden Fleece. And in the middle upon his Breaſt, was the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of a Plate of Gold, with the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Bird upon it.</hi> Epiſt. 18. Now this is very different from the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> of the High-Prieſt, which was made of Cloth beſet with Pretious ſtones. All the difficulty is what <hi>Diodorus</hi> means by his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by applying the <hi>Alethea</hi> to the contrary ſide. Now ſince no Hiſtory mentions any thing oracular in this; we cannot fancy it more than only ſome <hi>Hieroglyphical Memento</hi> to the Judges, of the Regard they ought to bear to Juſtice and Truth; or to the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:172675:141"/>
Witneſſes or <hi>Litigants,</hi> which the Chief Juſtice did often exhibit to them, to put them in mind of their Duty. But you will ſay, how then came the Jews to have an Uſage ſo very like the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> if they did not learn it from thence? Why, I anſwer it was a common Enſign of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in all Nations, to wear a Golden Chain, and many other People have uſed it as well as the Jews and the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi> Thus not only <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when he had a mind to advance <hi>Joſeph</hi> to honour and a place of great Truſt, put a Chain of Gold about his Neck, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.42. but the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> did the ſame to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, Dan.</hi> 5.29. For as Crowns and Scepters in all Nations have been Enſigns of the Regal Authority, ſo are Gold Chains and Rings Tokens of the higher Honour, and uſed not only by the Eaſtern <hi>Satrapae,</hi> but even by the noble <hi>Gauls</hi> in the Weſt. As is evident by what <hi>Pliny</hi> relates of the riſe of the Family of the <hi>Torquati</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> from the firſt <hi>Torquatus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plin. Hiſt. Lib. <hi>20.</hi>
                     </note> who was called ſo from his killing a noble <hi>Gaul</hi> and taking his Chain from him, yet reeking with blood, and puting it about his own Neck. Now what great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for wonder is there that the Chief Juſtice of <hi>Aegypt</hi> had a Chain, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Medal appendant to it diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:172675:141"/>
from other Nobles? Or why might not the Jewiſh High-Prieſt hang his Breaſt-Plate by a Golden Chain, without going to <hi>Aegypt</hi> for the Invention? For any other Nation could have taught that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful contrivance as well as the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> And as to the Appendants, there is ſo little agreement between them, <hi>viz.</hi> a Cloth a ſpan ſquare beſet with Jewels, and a Golden Medal repreſenting the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Bird, that one of theſe can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid to have given riſe to the other.</p>

                     </note> As for your borrowing the uſe of Linnen only for the Garments of the Prieſts; I think the juſt contrary thereof is true, and that the Jews in this were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfectly oppoſite to the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> than their Imitators. The Breaſt-Plate and Robe of the Jewiſh High-Prieſt were ordered to be made of Scarlet, Blue and Purple Woolen Cloth, only embroidered with wreaths of fine Linnen. But the uſe of Woollen Cloth was, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, execrable to the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſts, <hi>de Iſ. &amp; Oſyr.</hi> And <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Herod.

                     </note> that <hi>they wore only linnen, and ſhooes of the Papyrus, and that it is unlawful to them to uſe any other garments or ſhooes.</hi> But the Jewiſh High-Prieſts Robes were rather like the <hi>Babylonians</hi> than the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> For of the <hi>Babylonians Herodotus</hi> writes thus, <hi>This is the faſhion of their Clothing.

After ſo many Ages from the firſt uſe of <hi>Temples,</hi> it is a very difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exactly to aſcertain the Original of them. 'Tis true, <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſays the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> firſt invented them, becauſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> derived moſt of their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms from that Nation, and therefore the Greek Writers ſeldom fetch the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of any thing any further. I am apt to think that there was not a general
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:172675:146"/>
uſe of Temples, till ſuch time as Idolatry ſpread over the World, and had dedicated the Tombs of Heroes to a ſuperſtitious uſe. But yet long before this, and as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the <hi>Noachinal</hi> Times, there were not wanting <hi>Temples,</hi> or Houſes dedicated to a Religious uſe. For good Men in all Ages have uſed a Religious Worſhip in Publick, even in <hi>Enos</hi> his time, when <hi>men began to call upon the name of the Lord</hi> in publick Congregations, after Mankind was conſiderably increaſed; and therefore in great Cities and ſetled Polities the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of Temples for appointed places to meet together in, and to defend from the Injuries of the Weather, could not be long wanting. The ancienteſt places of Religious Worſhip I take to be <hi>Groves;</hi> which were uſed by the Patriarchs, and were Lawful places of Worſhip till ſuch time as, by reaſon of the Idolatrous ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition they were applied to, they were taken away by the Moſaical Law. So <hi>Lucian</hi> ſays, <hi>that Woods and Mountains were firſt conſecrated to the Gods.</hi> Lib de Sacrif. And <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaking of Trees ſays, <hi>Haec fuere Numinum Templa, priſco<expan>

places which maintain the ancient and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Rites, are wont to dedicate an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Tree to ſome God.</hi> Thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.33. Abraham <hi>planted a Grove in</hi> Berſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, <hi>and called there on the name of the Lord the Everlaſting God.</hi> And it probably was in a Grove, where <hi>Abraham</hi> deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Sacrifice <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and where the Ram was caught in a <hi>Thicket by his Horns,</hi> Gen. 22.13. And ſo probably was the place where <hi>Jacob</hi> ſlept, Gen. 28.22. which he ſays <hi>ſhall be called the houſe of God.</hi> Not that from hence can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that there were no Temples at that time, becauſe the Patriarchs did not uſe them. For they living a Paſtoral unſettled Life could not have conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to build them, and were therefore contented with the more ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom; but this very laſt Text implies there were at that time Temples or Houſes of God, becauſe <hi>Jacob,</hi> Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically, calls that ſtone, or Place ſo, which is an undoubted Alluſion to the Temples of thoſe Times. And in all probability <hi>Noah</hi> built a Temple pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the Flood, for the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Religious worſhip. He is in Scripture expreſly ſaid, to have <hi>built an Altar,</hi> Gen. 8.20. which is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who make the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:172675:147"/>
                     <hi>Aegyptians</hi> Inventors of Altars too. And why he might not build a Temple, as well as an Altar, I ſee no reaſon. Nay prophane Hiſtory gives a great deal of incouragement to the Conjecture that he did. For <hi>Lucian</hi> in his deſcription of the famous <hi>Syrian</hi> Temple before mentioned, ſays, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Moſt Men ſay that this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was built by</hi> Deucalion, <hi>namely that</hi> Deucalion <hi>in whoſe time the Deluge happened.</hi> So that this ancient Tradition makes Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as old as the Flood, and does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that <hi>Noah</hi> was the firſt builder of Temples. And <hi>Janus,</hi> whom learned Men will have to be another name for <hi>Noah</hi> too, is ſaid by <hi>Macrobius</hi> out of <hi>Zeno, primum in Italiâ templa feciſſe, &amp; ritus inſtituiſſe Sacrorum,</hi> Lib. 1. Sat. cap. 9. <hi>He firſt built Temples in</hi> Italy, <hi>and inſtituted Sacred Rites.</hi> So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole I think, there is vaſtly more reaſon to think, that the uſe of a Temple among the Jews came rather down to them by Patriarchal Tradition, than that it was copied from the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>And I doubt not,<note place="margin">Other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have Cuſtoms as like the Jewiſh</note> but that a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny uſages in the Jewiſh Law came the ſame way, and were taken up both by the Heathens and them from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:172675:149"/>
miſerable ignorant People, and after all their mighty pretences to the Knowledge of the Divine Nature, are ſcandalouſly ignorant concerning it. They every where ſeem to be groſs <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting God as having Eyes, and Hands, and Feet. <hi>Adam</hi> to whom God made his firſt Revelation, knew nothing of God's Omnipreſence, or Omniſcience, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to hide himſelf from him, and to make a ſimple Excuſe to him. And <hi>Moſes,</hi> who relates the ſtory brings in God like a Man walking in the Garden. The ſame <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo ſilly as to fancy God viſible, and to deſire to ſee him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. And ſome of the Prophets endow God with humane Paſſion, and make him to repent, to be ſorry, and to be glad. But above all the contrivance of the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> is the wiſeſt, who thought to run away to <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> out of God Almighty's reach, as if God had no power out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Judea.</hi> Now who can expect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to come from thoſe Heads, which were not furniſhed with the common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of natural Religion?</p>

                  <p>You do a great injury to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures and to the memory of the Holy Men, recorded there, to conceive ſuch an extravagant Opinion of them:

eſpecially when it is taught there, that God is a Spirit, that he beholds all things, is preſent every where, that he is not a Man,<note place="margin">Jews far from being Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphites.</note> and the like. And therefore you ought in all candor to ſuppoſe that theſe expreſſions which attribute Hands, Eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to God, are only to be taken meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically, and are ſpoke only <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Now the true reaſon why the Scripture does expreſs the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God by Bodily actions and properties, is not, that thoſe Writers thought God of a bodily ſhape, but by the reaſon of the narrowneſs of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Tongue they wanted abſtracted Terms to expreſs them by. And when theſe Corporeal Terms were applied to God, the People of that Nation knew as well what was meant by them, as the Schools do by all their <hi>Quiddities.</hi> Thus the <hi>Eye</hi> of God is the ſame as the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.12. <hi>Caſt thine eye upon him (i. e.)</hi> take care of him. And 2 Chr. 16.9. <hi>The Eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole Earth; (i. e.)</hi> God takes care of all People in it. So the <hi>Heart</hi> of God was as well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to the Jews, as if it had in more Scholaſtick Language been called his <hi>Decree,</hi> or his <hi>Will. David</hi> was a Man after God's own heart, that is, lived as he would have him, or according to his <hi>Will,</hi> or Laws. By the <hi>Mouth of God</hi> they eaſily underſtood his <hi>revealed Will,</hi> by the <hi>Hand of God</hi> his <hi>Power.</hi> By God's <hi>ariſing,</hi> his Vengeance; by his <hi>hiding himſelf,</hi> his Dereliction, or withholding his Grace and Providence. <hi>Vid Maim.

Sac. ed. per David Hoeſchelium.</hi> Nor is there any reaſon to blame the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for theſe Metaphorical ways of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Nature of God, becauſe they are beſt adapted to give the People an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them,<note place="margin">Hebrew Language as well expreſſes the nature of God as the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical.</note> and to animate their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections towards God; whilſt dry Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical and abſt acted terms would lie flat upon their Minds, and ſerve only to amuſe and confound them. And after all, the moſt preciſe and Philoſophick way of ſpeaking concerning the Deity muſt needs be very improper and altogether Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical. For Languages were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſpeak of the Deity, but for Men to maintain an intercourſe with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and therefore unleſs we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a perfect ſet of new words, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak at all of God if we ſhould not uſe our old Terms in a tralatitious ſenſe. And thus the words <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> &amp;c. if we reſpect their Original uſe, and do not take them in a Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſenſe, are altogether as abſurd, when applied to the Deity, as the Eye, or Hand, or Heart of God, in the groſſeſt ſenſe: For how improper is it, literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking, to ſay, God <hi>looks before</hi> him like Men when they act cautiouſly, or that God has that yearning of Bowels
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:172675:151"/>
which pittiful Men have over a compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Object? And truly if we ſhould perfectly contrive new Words to ſpeak of theſe tranſcendent Truths, they are ſo far above the reach of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and we are acquainted ſo little with them, that even then there would be a World of improprieties in our ſpeech concerning them. Therefore I think, that we may ſit down very well contented with the Jewiſh Forms of Speech concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nature of God; and that we have rather great reaſon to bleſs his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ordering it to be explained in ſuch a way as is intelligible to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt People, who would have been but amuſed and diſtracted at the abſtruſe niceties and explications which Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick and Scholaſtick brains would have made concerning it. This I take to be a very proper Explication of thoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Parts</hi> and Affections which are in many places of Scripture attributed to God.</p>
                  <p>But as concerning ſome natural Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are applied to him, as his Walking, Coming, Going, Wreſtling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this to be attributed to the Angel which did repreſent the Deity in thoſe Appearances. And I doubt not but it was ſuch a Vicarious Angel which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:172675:152"/>
frequently before the Fall to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in Paradiſe. And that it was the <hi>Voice,</hi> or ſound of him <hi>whom they heard walking in the Garden in the Cool of the Day.</hi> That is, they heard that Wind or Voice which uſed to go before the Repreſenting Angel which they were ſufficiently acquainted with. For with this circumſtance the divine Appearance uſed to be attended. As the <hi>Lord anſwered</hi> Job <hi>out of the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,</hi> Job 28. And 1 Kings 19. <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the Lord paſſed by, and a great and ſtrong wind rent the mountains,</hi> and after that, an Earth-quake, and a Fire, and ſtill ſmall Voice. Now the guilty couple underſtanding by theſe preludes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the vicarious Angel hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for fear. Nor did they pretend to make ſimple Excuſes to God Almighty out of Ignorance of his Omniſcience, as you falſly imagine. For they are ſo far from that, that they unhappy Creatures plainly confeſs the fact upon the firſt charge, in all the naked circumſtances of it. <hi>The woman whom thou gaveſt me to be with me, gave me of the Tree, and I did eat. The Serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</hi> There is nothing in theſe words which implies any thing like ſuch abſurd Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes. Only ſome fanciful Expoſitors
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:172675:152"/>
will make <hi>Adam</hi> here to ſhift off the Crime upon his Wife, which <hi>God had given him,</hi> and to caſt a ſevere Reflection upon God's Ordinance of Wedlock, which they ſay he here ſlily inſinuate to be the cauſe of his Fall; and will have <hi>Eve</hi> to lay all her blame upon the Devil. But the words import no ſuch thing, here is only a juſt confeſſion of exact matter of fact; and I think there is no reaſon they ſhould make their caſe worſe than it was, and take the blame of others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, when they had ſufficient of their own. Neither is it to be ſuppoſed that <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee the Divine Eſſence, but only to have the Glory of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Angel more particularly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to him which had hitherto been wrapt up in a Cloud; that That might be a more evident Token to the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring Jews of his divine Miſſion. And it pleaſed God to hearken to this requeſt, and to let the divine glory make ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon his Face as dazled the Eyes of his Beholders. And the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaw the face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the Skin of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s face ſhone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as for your inſtance in <hi>Jonas,</hi> which you Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ſo much in, no body can with any reaſon think, that he ſhould be ſo ſilly, as to imagin that that Great God whom he
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:172675:153"/>
worſhiped as the Maker of Heaven and Earth, ſhould have no power over him out of the land of <hi>Judea;</hi> or that he could ſuppoſe when he got to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> he ſhould be out of God's preſence. That was the leaſt of <hi>Jonas</hi>'s Thoughts; and the words of the Text do not imply any thing like it. It is ſaid, <hi>Jonas</hi> aroſe up to fly to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> not <hi>Miphne,</hi> from the face or preſence of God, but <hi>Milipene</hi> from before the face or preſence of God; <hi>dead facies Jehovae:</hi> That is, he turned his back upon God at that hazardous and uncomfortable Revelation, and endeavoured by any ways to get off from the Appearance of God at that Time. He might have thought of any other place to flie to, where his dejected Fancy let him, as well as <hi>Tarſhiſh;</hi> but only that place lying juſt contrary to <hi>Ninive,</hi> he contrived to fly thither. He could not think of avoiding God's univerſal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which he could not but know was every where, but only by flying ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he might avoid God's <hi>Prophetick preſence</hi> at that time which he had either hopes he ſhould not be tried with again, elſe fondly imagained, as moſt of the other Jews did, that no Revelation could be afforded in a Gentile Country.</p>

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:172675:154"/>
actions of the holy Prophets, without conſidering the Cuſtoms of thoſe times, and the extraordinary Meſſages they were ſent about. There are none of their Prophetick Speeches which were delivered to the Princes of thoſe times, but what are made with all due Decency and regard to their Character; but yet the Prophets having an immediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God himſelf, they ought to have ſpoken with greater Boldneſs to them than every ordinary Haranguer, who could only pretend to ſpeak by way of Perſwaſion. When they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God, to reprimand wicked Princes, and to denounce Judgments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, they had betrayed their Truſt if they had not ſpoken the Truth with boldneſs; and had incurred the penalty of thoſe who feared God leſs than Man. And as for ſome unuſual actions which they did, as <hi>Micaiah's making him Horns of Iron,</hi> that was the uſual way of thoſe Times to propheſy by <hi>ſigns:</hi> for under ſuch <hi>Hieroglyphical</hi> repreſentations moſt of the Morality and Divinity of the Eaſtern Nations were couched. Neither were all thoſe <hi>ſigns</hi> which are related in the Prophetick Writings really acted, but ſome of them only in Viſion; and this in all probability was the caſe of <hi>Hoſea,</hi>
                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:172675:154"/>
when he <hi>took the Wife of Whoredoms,</hi> and of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> when he is ſaid to have lain ſo many days on one ſide. As for your Inſtances in the Prophets <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Hanani; Samuel</hi> had had the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jewiſh Theocracy immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately under God, before <hi>Saul,</hi> and was a Prince when he was but a Peaſant, had ſingled him out and Anointed him King, and when beſides he had the command of God to rebuke that headſtrong King; this will bear him out in all his ſeverity of Expreſſions he uſed towards him. And as for <hi>Hanani,</hi> he did very juſtly reprove King <hi>Aſa,</hi> for his relying on the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and not on the Lord his God. 'Tis not his bare making a League with the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> which he is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for, but for his putting more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in this than in God's Providence. Beſides, to compaſs this he had uſed very indirect means; for he purchaſed that King's favour, by ſacrilegiouſly taking the Treaſures of the Houſe of the Lord 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 16.7. to make a preſent to him.' And though the Scripture does affirm of this King <hi>Aſa, that his heart was perfect all his days,</hi> yet this is to be underſtood only of his Zeal againſt Idolatry; yet ſeveral grievous faults he was guilty of, as particularly the impriſoning this Holy

                  <p>We are arrived now at laſt to a leiſure to talk more particularly of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip, and a ſatisfaction to be made for Sins. Now your whole Religion is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed upon the ſuppoſition of that which is all falſe and erroneous, and inconſiſtent with the Nature and goodneſs of God. For this ſuppoſes God a rough implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Being, that is eaſy to be offended, and hard to be pleaſed; when on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nothing is ſo good and kind and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be reconciled to his Creatures. Indeed the wickedneſs of Men, who have been apt to think every one as bad as themſelves, has inclined them to have ſuch hard Thoughts of God Almighty, and made many of them think, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages ago, the Deity to be a ſevere ſort of Being, and the ſubtile Prieſts found it for their Advantage to encourage the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and hence the Practice of Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing got into the World. For when Men found they had done ſomething which was diſpleaſing to God Almighty, they thought to make him amends another way, and ſo would ſacrifice a good fat Bullock or Ram, at his Altar. This
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:172675:155"/>
was the firſt ſilly Logick in early and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Ages, and the Prieſts for their profit have been improving it ever ſince; till at laſt they have vamped it up into that Mediatorſhip and ſatisfaction which the Chriſtian Religion is grounded upon. But in the firſt and purer Ages of the World, theſe idle worſhips were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, when they worſhiped God with Prayers only, and Praiſe, and never thought of appeaſing the Deity with theſe fooliſh Briberies, which muſt be ſo far from being grateful to him, that they muſt needs be his Averſation.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Expiation conſiſtent with the Mercy of God.</note>You run away a little too faſt with your Argument, when you make ſuch exclamations about the ſeverity and implacableneſs of the Deity, where it is aſſerted, that he requires Expiation and Satisfaction for Mens Sins. Wicked Men, that are reſolved to live on in a Courſe of Sin, may flatter themſelves, that God has nothing in him but Mercy; but I am afraid in time they will find, That God in his Laws has regard to his Juſtice too. I will not aſſert, That it is impoſſible that God as God, all whoſe
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:172675:156"/>
Attributes are infinite, ſhould forgive the Sins of Men without a ſatisfaction to his Juſtice; but yet I ſay, that conſidering God as a Legiſlatour who deſigns to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern Men by his Laws, it is not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Wiſdom to ſuffer his Laws, to be trampled upon with impunity by Bold and Regardleſs Sinners. And indeed all God Almighty's Attributes are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by his infinite Reaſon and Wiſdom, and his Mercy is not, as a great many take it to be, a ſort of Feminine tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that cannot hold out againſt the Cries of ſuffering Offenders: but ſuch a good and wiſe relaxation of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which his Juſtice in rigor might demand, as may ſecure the honour of his Laws, his Eternal Juſtice and Purity, and with all make all poſſible allowances for the Infirmities of Mankind. And upon this reaſon I take the nature of Expiatory Sacrifices in all Ages to have been groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to ſhew the great Averſion God has always had to Sin, and to deter Men from Sin, by ſhewing the great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he required for it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do not approve the Reaſon which a late Author<note n="*" place="margin">Diſcourſe concerning Natural and Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>p. 100.</hi>
                     </note> gives, that the end of Sacrifices was to make <hi>Sin coſtly to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,</hi> and <hi>to appeaſe the Conſciences of penitent Sinners,</hi> by ſhewing that God
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:172675:157"/>
accepted the Death of the Beaſt in lieu of theirs. For theſe are only general Ends, but the moſt principal and particular End which was aimed at in the Sacrifices of Beaſts was, that they might be Types and Fore-runners of the Great Sacrifice of our Bleſſed Lord, from the Efficacy of whoſe infinite ſatisfaction they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all their Expiatory Nature. For as the Apoſtle argues, Heb. 10.6. <hi>It is not poſſible that the blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away Sins;</hi> and therefore theſe muſt all have reference to the infinite ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Chriſt, which alone can. So that theſe Beſtial Sacrifices both before and under the Law, were to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt as the Tabernacle to the Temple, God Almighty was pleaſed to accept them as expiatory till ſuch time as that great Sacrifice was finiſhed: but as when the Temple was built, the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was deſtroy'd. So after the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, theſe ritual Sacrifices were at an End. Nay we have rather great reaſon to adore the infinite Mercy of God, than to tax him with ſeverity, for accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch vicarious ſufferings; for he might in juſtice have demanded the perſonal ſuffering of the Offended himſelf, his Life, for every Trangreſſion, which would ſoon have put an end to the Race
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:172675:157"/>
of ſinful Mankind. To have forgiven all without any ſatisfaction would have been in effect to have given an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable licence to Sin; and to have puniſhed to the utmoſt rigor, would have left no room for Men to adore his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: but by this admirable mixture of Juſtice and Compaſſion, his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is preſerved, and Mens Sins are pardoned.</p>
                  <p>Neither can I aſſent to your Opinion,<note place="margin">The Origin of Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</note> that Sacrifices are the pure Invention of Men, for it is highly probable that they were at firſt inſtituted by God Almighty, and Directions for the performance of theſe ſacrificial Rites given to the firſt of Mankind, and ſo have been handed down to the ſeveral Branches of their Poſterity ever ſince. Indeed, <hi>Grotius,</hi> and ſome others are of Opinion, that Sacrifices owe their Original to the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Mankind, who in thanks to God were willing to return back to God ſome part of the good things they did enjoy; and that before the Flood there was no Sacrifice offer'd of Animal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

is his reaſon convincing, by which he would prove that no Beaſt was Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed till after the Deluge; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe Sacrifices are never but of ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he Deluge, that indulgence being afterwards granted to <hi>Noah,</hi> he concludes, that no fleſh was Sacrificed. But this Argument is but weak. For it is very much to be doubted whether the Antediluvians did not eat fleſh; and <hi>Bochartus</hi> contends ſtrongly that the Grant to <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 9. was not larger than what was afforded to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 1. And beſides in piacular Sacrifices in many Nations they never ſtood upon the edibility of the Sacrifice; but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Sacrificed Horſes or Men. Beſides, it is probable that theſe Expiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Blood commenced from the firſt fall of Mankind, to be the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or vicarious Puniſhments for the Lives of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Off-ſpring then forfeited. And then there is ſome reaſon for their Inſtitution at that time; but there is none that I know for their being ſet up in the Time of <hi>Noah.</hi> And when the Scripture ſays expreſly that <hi>Abel</hi> Offered <hi>of the firſtlings of his Flock and the fat thereof,</hi> methinks it is a jejune interpretation, to ſay he Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered only <hi>Lanam &amp; lac pinguiſſimum,</hi>

I am therefore perſwaded, and I think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good ground, that a Model of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Rites, or at leaſt a command in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of Piacular Sacrifices was given to our firſt Parents, and by them tranſmitted down to all their Poſterity. For otherways it is impoſſible to give a ſatisfactory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count why we ſhould meet with the ſame in all Ages, in all Countries from the Eaſt to the Weſt-<hi>Indies,</hi> from <hi>Africa</hi> to <hi>Scythia,</hi> and there find Men practiſing the ſame Piacular Rites almoſt in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form manner. If their Sacrifices were owing to the Gratitude or Reaſoning of the different Inhabitants, they would be as widely different as their Cuſtoms and Manners are; but when we find ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different People that have no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with one another doing exactly the ſame things as if it were by confederacy, killing the Sacrifice, burning the Fleſh, and that too upon an Altar, by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of a Prieſt, and with an Opinion that their ſins are diſcharged by that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious puniſhment of the devoted Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, with many other like circumſtances; this muſt needs prove that they could not all jump upon theſe things by chance, but had them delivered down to them by

But the deſign of them is to ſhew, that Men ſhould not place their Obedience only in the Ritual Parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whilſt they neglect the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Duties of Morality; and this is a Truth which every honeſt Chriſtian, as well as you Deiſts, thinks himſelf bound to believe.</p>

ſeem but inſignificant Trifles in matter of Religion, becauſe they do not make Men the better or the more innocent.

So that the Mediatorſhip without Repentance ſignifies nothing at all, and Repentance where they know nothing of this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorſhip muſt by all charitable Men be allow'd to be valid; and therefore what need of the Mediatorſhip or ſatisfaction at all?

This is that which gave life to the ſtipulation between Chriſt and the Father, that He ſhould dy for the ſins of the whole World, in which all ſufficient Sacrifice all other Expiations received their Force and Energy. And it's likewiſe true, that after Sin committed, Repentance and Amendment is all we can do on our Parts. But then further we Chriſtians ſay that the Mediatorſhip muſt do ſomething like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe on God's part as well as ours. By Sin God's honour is violated, and our Lives are forfeited, now both theſe are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied by the Efficacy of the Mediator. Indeed Mercy for God to Pardon, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for us to amend, is all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for our ſecurity. But then on the other ſide why muſt there be no ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given for the injured honour of God? God may be as merciful to the World as he pleaſes, but ſtill he muſt be juſt to his own Dignity; for otherways he would deveſt himſelf of the Government of the World, and leave impudent Sinners to Sin without controul. And therefore we ſay that therein lies the admirable Wiſdom of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:172675:160"/>
the Mediatorſhip, that both Parties are thereby ſatisfied; God has the ſecurity of his Honour, and Man of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>But, <hi>Credentius,</hi> this ſatisfaction, as you call it, in the Mediatorſhip, is a Buſineſs which lies ſo croſs in my Brains, and is pregnant with ſuch a number of Abſurdities, that I can never away with it. And therefore you ſee, that not only we, but your Brother Chriſtians the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> are ſo aware of the Groſsneſs of this Doctrine, that they are unanimouſly agreed upon it, to explode it; as giving Men ſuch a barbarous notion of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, as is inconſiſtent with the Excellency of his Nature. For ſatisfaction does ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an angry revengeful Temper, which deſires to be glutted with the puniſhment of the offending Party; which when that is brought about, becomes tame, good-natur'd, and reconcileable. But this is ſuch a pitiful imbecillity, even in humane nature, as wiſe Men are aſhamed of; and therefore to attribute this to the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Purity and Wiſdom of God, is no leſs, I think, than the moſt daring Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. But ſuppoſing there was ſuch an Angry Vindictive Nature in the Deity, yet methinks even then he ſhould rather chooſe to take revenge upon every one
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:172675:161"/>
for their own Demerits, which would be agreeable to Juſtice; and not make one Innocent Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, who had no Sin, as you ſuppoſe, to ſuffer for the Sins of all other wicked Men; and to lay the deſerved Sufferings of ſo many outragious Offenders upon the back of the moſt pious and ſpotleſs Man, that, by your account, ever came into the World. But when we farther conſider, that this innocent Perſon is owned by you to be the Son of God, and his only Son too, and muſt nevertheleſs be Sacrificed to appeaſe this Vindictive nature of God before he could be reconciled to the World: this is ſuch a horrid Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Beſt of Beings, as ſhocks hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature to conſider; and far outdoes all the ſtories of <hi>Scythian</hi> Sacrifices, and <hi>Buſiris</hi> his Altars. And yet greater Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Abſurdities do appear, when we conſider, That this ſuffering Perſon was the ſupreme God himſelf, who by this Scheme is ſuppoſed to have took upon him all the Infirmities of an Human Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, was hungry and thirſty, and at laſt, was crucified, and died.

Indeed the word <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> is not found in Scripture, but the whole ſubſtance of what the word imports, is; and this and all other words which are uſed to expreſs any of the divine actions, or nature, muſt be uſed Metaphorically, and not be taken in ſo ſtrict a ſenſe, as when they are uſed properly, and according to their original application.

Now whereas the whole Oeconomy of our Salvation is delivered in Scripture in Forenſical Terms, as when God is repreſented as a Judge, Man as an Offender or Criminal; God's word as the Law by which he is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, Death as the Puniſhment, Chriſt as a Mediator and Surety, his Death as an <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:172675:162"/>
Juſtice, upon account of our Sins, by the name of Satisfaction. For this is no bloody revengeful ſatisfaction, which impotent and paſſionate Minds are wont to call for; but only ſuch a juſt debt as ought to be pay'd to the Juſtice of God, conſidered as the Governour of the World. I am not inſenſible, that ſome <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Writers have carried this matter a little too far, by leaving no room at all for the Mercy of God to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert it ſelf in this wonderful diſpenſation, and making the divine Juſtice to require a ſatisfaction to be made, by the ſame ſpecifick Infinite Puniſhments which we had deſerved, in the Sufferings of our Saviour; ſo as to think that no ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction could be, unleſs Chriſt actually ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon the Croſs all the Eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Damned <hi>intenſivè,</hi> as they ſpeak, though not <hi>extenſivè;</hi> ſo that our Saviour in his Agony and Crucifixion, muſt ſuffer Torments as much infinitely greater than Damned Souls, as their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Suffering is longer than the hours of our Saviour's Paſſion. But this has no foundation in Scripture, and ſeems hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid to Chriſtian Ears. It is enough to ſay, That the Mercy of God diſpoſed him to accept of the Temporal Sufferings of Chriſt for our Sins in lieu of the Eternal
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:172675:162"/>
puniſhments, which we had deſerved. And ſo the infinite dignity of the perſon ſuffering was a ſufficient ſatisfaction to the Divine Juſtice offended, and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mercy was ſhewn to offending Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by being free from that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which otherways they muſt have undergone themſelves. So that Infidel and <hi>Socinian</hi> ſcoffers do very ill to arraign the Mercy of God, and to tax him with Revenge and Implacability in demanding ſuch a Legal ſatisfaction; for by the ſame Rules they might expoſe all the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Authority in the World when Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals ſuffer by their ſanctions.

For that vicarious puniſhments are not in themſelves abſolutely unjuſt, may be proved not only from Scripture Inſtances where Children are puniſhed for their Parents, and Subjects for their Princes; but by the notion which the moſt civilized Nations have always had of the lawfulneſs of puniſhing ſureties for the Parties they were engaged for, by their denying the publick honours to the Children of notorious Offenders, by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimations in their Armies, and by killing the innocent Hoſtages when the Articles were not performed. Now if the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> who of all other Nations pretend to the exacteſt Rules of the <hi>aequum bonumque,</hi> could ſee no obliquity in theſe vicarious puniſhments; there is certainly a far leſs pretence of injuſtice to be laid to God's charge in ordering Chriſt to ſuffer for the Sins of the World. Now it is impoſſible here that there ſhould be any injuſtice, or injury. Here was no injuſtice done to Chriſt, for he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed voluntarily to lay down his Life for us. Neither was it any injuſtice done to God, for God Authorized him to do it, by a mutual ſtipulation betwixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     </gap>, <hi>to lay down my Life.</hi> So that there is no more injuſtice commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our Saviour's laying down his Life in a voluntary Suffering for us; than there is in his laying it down according to <hi>Socinus</hi> his Notion, for a Teſtimony of his Doctrine. And I am ſure I could prove it as equally unjuſt for God to put him upon preaching a Doctrine that would coſt him his Life; as to let him lay down his Life to ſave a World.</p>

But by reaſon of the Union of the Deity with Fleſh or Humanity which was Patible, Chriſt was then in a poſſibility of ſuffering, and thoſe ſufferings which were proper only to one Nature are attributed to the whole perſon by reaſon of the intimate Union of the two Natures. Nay the Scripture it ſelf attributes the properties of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the Humanity, to the Divinity the ſuperior one. As when it

is ſaid, that <hi>we are redeemed by the blood of God;</hi> we muſt not think as if God could bleed or die, but that That Perſon who was both God and Man, who by vertue of his Humanity, was capable of ſuffering, laid down his Life for us, to redeem us. Now here is nothing in this of Abſurdity but only adorable myſtery, and admirable Wiſdom, which the Thoughts of Man could never have reached to, and no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Counſel could ever have contrived: To find out ſuch a way to ſave the Souls of Loſt Mankind, and to ſecure God's honour, and the Authority of his Laws.</p>

                  <p>I have one thing more to objects to you upon this head, and that is the Chriſtian Doctrine which you teach about Chriſt's Interceſſion, and that is ſo odd and groſs a notion, as no rational Man can aſſent to. For you make Chriſt continually at his Prayers in Heaven to God the Father, to pardon the Sins of Mankind upon their Repentance, and to beſtow his Benefits upon them; which God in his own nature is inclined to do, without this buſtle of Interceſſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it looks like a piece of Pageantry (as your Doctors explain it) to have Chriſt continually exhibiting the wounds of his Crucified Body to the Father, to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:172675:164"/>
move him to compaſſion, and to put him in mind of the Sacrifice he was made for Mans Sins, which it is impoſſible that an Omnipotent Knowledge could be unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of. Methinks this looks like a Piece of Homerick Divinity, when the Poet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes Heaven acording to all the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and ſillineſſes which are ſeen in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature.</p>

All that we can be certain of is what the Scripture tells us, that <hi>we have an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1. that he is ſaid <hi>to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for us at the right hand of God,</hi> Rom. 8.34. that <hi>he is entered into Heaven it ſelf now to appear in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9.24. that <hi>he is a Prieſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> and his blood <hi>ſpeaks better things than that of Abel,</hi> that he <hi>offers his own
